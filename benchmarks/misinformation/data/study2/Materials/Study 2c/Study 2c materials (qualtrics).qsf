To be eligible to participate, you must be 18 years of age or older.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY: We are interested in your opinions about various news headlines. Specifically, we are most interested in whether you would consider sharing them on social media. You will also be asked to answer various questions about your political ideology and beliefs, thinking style, and various demographics. We are interested in people&rsquo;s opinion about news media and why they have such opinions.&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nPROCEDURES:&nbsp;Should you agree to participate, you will be invited to answer questions about a set of news headlines along with a decision-making task and various demographics questions. The expected time to complete the study is around 15 minutes. After completing the study, you will be provided with compensation&nbsp;as a thank-you for your time.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nPOTENTIAL RISKS:&nbsp;There are no anticipated risks associated with participation in this study.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS:&nbsp;Although there are no direct benefits associated with participation, participants will receive compensation for completing the study. Participants may also benefit indirectly from knowing that they have advanced our understanding of psychological decision-making processes.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nCONFIDENTIALITY:&nbsp;Your Lucid&nbsp;ID will be recorded for purposes of compensation. In addition, the Qualtrics survey software automatically records your IP address. However, this information will only be accessible to the primary researchers and will be removed from the data file.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nSTORAGE OF DATA:&nbsp;Original electronic data will be stored securely with password protection. Only the primary researchers will have access to the original electronic data. Lucid IDs and IP addresses will then be removed from the data file and (upon submission of manuscripts associated with this research) it will be posted online for the sake of the broader scientific community. The data collected will be analyzed in aggregate and will be used to inform future research studies, submitted for publication in an academic journal and may be presented at conferences.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nRIGHT TO WITHDRAW:&nbsp; Participation is entirely voluntary. If you decide to participate you are free to discontinue participation at any time without question or penalty.
