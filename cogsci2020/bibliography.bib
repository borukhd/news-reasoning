@article{khemlani2012,
	Abstract = {Syllogisms are arguments about the properties of entities. They consist of 2 premises and a conclusion, which can each be in 1 of 4 ``moods'': All A are B, Some A are B, No A are B, and Some A are not B. Their logical analysis began with Aristotle, and their psychological investigation began over 100 years ago. This article outlines the logic of inferences about syllogisms, which includes the evaluation of the consistency of sets of assertions. It also describes the main phenomena of reasoning about properties. There are 12 extant theories of such inferences, and the article outlines each of them and describes their strengths and weaknesses. The theories are of 3 main sorts: heuristic theories that capture principles that could underlie intuitive responses, theories of deliberative reasoning based on formal rules of inference akin to those of logic, and theories of deliberative reasoning based on set-theoretic diagrams or models. The article presents a meta-analysis of these extant theories of syllogisms using data from 6 studies. None of the 12 theories provides an adequate account, and so the article concludes with a guide\textemdash{} based on its qualitative and quantitative analyses\textemdash{} of how best to make progress toward a satisfactory theory.},

However, the neural processes underlying the ability to draw conclusions about relations are still not sufficiently understood. Central open questions are as follows: (1) What are the neural correlates of relational reasoning? (2) Where can deductive and inductive reasoning be localized? (3) What is the impact of different informational types on cerebral activity? For that, we conducted a meta-analysis of 47 neuroimaging studies. We found activation of the frontoparietal network during both deductive and inductive reasoning, with additional activation in an extended network during inductive reasoning in the basal ganglia and the inferior parietal cortex.},

	Abstract = {Examined age-comparative evidence of social cognitive reasoning in adulthood, as mediated by the emotional saliency of tasks tapping postformal reasoning. Specifically, the tasks focused on the ability to resolve discrepant accounts of the same event sequence. It was assumed that less mature thinking may be more evident in reasoning contexts in which emotional factors play a major role. A postformal coding scheme was used to assess levels of reasoning in an interpersonal context. Tasks were administered to 60 Ss\textemdash{}20 adolescents (aged 14\textendash{}16.5 yrs), 20 young adults (aged 20\textendash{}25 yrs), and 20 mature adults (aged 30\textendash{}46 yrs). Measures of formal operations, ego level, and verbal ability were also administered, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Sentence Completion Test. An interaction was found between age and degree of emotional saliency of the task for reasoning level. Specifically, adolescents performed less well on tasks higher in degree of emotional saliency. In addition, developmental differences in postformal reasoning as a function of age and ego level were found. (44 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{bello,
	Abstract = {People's ability to predict and explain the beliefs, desires and actions of others, often called their Theory of Mind (ToM) is an central component of cognition. There is ample experimental evidence suggesting a major developmental shift in children's ToM somewhere between the ages of three and five (Wellman, Cross \& Watson 2001). These results are often interpreted in terms of children acquiring rich understanding of belief and its representational nature. Both of these descriptors are ambiguous and controversial. This makes evaluating the evidence of such a shift, and its implication about the knowledge and mechanisms underlying ToM more difficult. Computational cognitive models are precise by nature, and can help resolve many of these difficulties. We present Polyscheme/ToM, a computational model of human behavior in some important ToM tasks. It uses a domain-general mechanism for representing alternate states of affairs in order to represent the way other people view the world. We demonstrate that the model has several implications: 1) it is possible to succeed in false belief tasks without explicitly representing beliefs; 2) behavior in experiments purporting to show success in false-belieflike tasks at earlier ages require significantly simpler mechanisms than success in the traditional false-belief task, and 3) the shift from younger to older behavior in these tasks can be accounted for by small, but highly consequential changes in cognitive mechanisms.},

@article{mareschal2007,
	Abstract = {This manuscript surveys computational modeling efforts by researchers in developmental psychology. Developmental psychology is ready to blossom into a modern science that focuses on causal mechanistic explanations of development rather than just describing and classifying behaviors. Computational modeling is the key to this process. However, to be effective, models must not only mimic observed data. They must also be transparent, grounded, and plausible to be accepted by the developmental psychology community. Connectionist model provides one such example. Many developmental features of typical and atypical perception, cognition, and language have been modeled using connectionist methods. Successful models are closely tied to the details of existing empirical studies and make concrete testable predictions. The success of such a project relies on the close collaboration of computational scientists with empirical psychologists},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) is a form of deductive reasoning that allows one to derive a
relation between items that have not been explicitly compared before. In a general form,
TI is the ability to deduce that if Item B is related to Item C and Item C is related to Item
D, then Item B must be related to Item D. This chapter begins with discussions of the
methodology of nonverbal TI research, followed by problems in interpreting the results of
TI research. It reviews cognitive and reinforcement-based models of TI and considers
research on neurobiological mechanisms of nonverbal inferences. It shows that with the
single exception of honey bees, every species tested so far has been found to exhibit
transitive-like behavior in an n-term series task. Whether this overwhelming incidence of
success means that animals truly make inferences, however, has been a matter of a
considerable debate that continues to this day. The author concludes that current
experimental evidence does not strongly support either cognitive models or
reinforcement-based models of TI.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference has long been considered one of the hallmarks of human deductive reasoning. Recent reports of transitive-like behaviors in non-human animals have prompted a flourishing empirical and theoretical search for the mechanism(s) that may mediate this ability in non-humans. In this paper, I begin by describing the transitive inference tasks customarily used with non-human animals and then review the empirical findings. Transitive inference has been demonstrated in a wide variety of species, and the signature effects that usually accompany transitive inference in humans (the serial position effect and the symbolic distance effect) have also been found in non-humans. I then critically analyze the most prominent models of this ability in non-human animals. Some models are cognitive, proposing for instance that animals use the rules of formal logic or form mental representations of the premises to solve the task, others are based on associative mechanisms such as value transfer and reinforcement and non-reinforcement. Overall, I argue that the reinforcement-based models are in a much better empirical and theoretical position. Hence, transitive inference in non-human animals should be considered a property of reinforcement history rather than of inferential processes. I finalize by shedding some light on some promising lines of research.},

	Abstract = {Minimal procedures for the demonstration of transitive inference (TI) in animals have involved the training of four simultaneous discriminations: for example, A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, and D+E-, followed by the demonstration of a preference for B over D on test trials. In Experiment 1, we found that TI in pigeons can be found with successive training involving A+B-, B+C-, A+C-, C+D-, D+E-, C+E-, and A+E-. In Experiment 2, we found that demonstration of TI did not require inclusion of experience with the nonadjacent stimulus pairs (A+C-, C+E-, A+E-). Experiment 3 provided a test of value transfer theory (VTT; Fersen, Wynne, Delius, \& Staddon, 1991). When pigeons were trained with stimulus pairs that did not permit the transitive ordering of stimuli, but did permit the differential transfer of value (e.g., A+B-, C-E+, C+D-, \& A+E-), preference for B over D was still found. Analyses of the relation between direct experiences with reinforced and nonreinforced responding and stimulus preferences on test trials failed to support a reinforcement-history account of TI.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference (the ability to infer that B {$>$} D given that B {$>$} C and C {$>$} D) is a widespread characteristic of serial learning, observed in dozens of species. Despite these robust behavioral effects, reinforcement learning models reliant on reward prediction error or associative strength routinely fail to perform these inferences. We propose an algorithm called betasort, inspired by cognitive processes, which performs transitive inference at low computational cost. This is accomplished by (1) representing stimulus positions along a unit span using beta distributions, (2) treating positive and negative feedback asymmetrically, and (3) updating the position of every stimulus during every trial, whether that stimulus was visible or not. Performance was compared for rhesus macaques, humans, and the betasort algorithm, as well as Q-learning, an established reward-prediction error (RPE) model. Of these, only Q-learning failed to respond above chance during critical test trials. Betasort's success (when compared to RPE models) and its computational efficiency (when compared to full Markov decision process implementations) suggests that the study of reinforcement learning in organisms will be best served by a feature-driven approach to comparing formal models.},

To test this concept, we compared highly social pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, with relatively nonsocial western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica, on two complex cognitive tasks relevant to the ability to track and assess social relationships. Pinyon jays learned to track multiple dyadic relationships more rapidly and more accurately than scrub-jays and appeared to display a more robust and accurate mechanism of transitive inference. These results provide a clear demonstration of the association between social complexity and cognition in animals.},

@article{guez2013,
	Abstract = {Transitive inference has been historically touted as a hallmark of human cognition. However, the ability of non-human animals to perform this type of inference is being increasingly investigated. Experimentally, three main methods are commonly used to evaluate transitivity in animals: those that investigate social dominance relationships, the n-term task series and the less well known associative transitivity task. Here, we revisit the question of what exactly constitutes transitive inference based upon a formal and habitual definition and propose two essential criteria for experimentally testing it in animals. We then apply these criteria to evaluate the existing body of work on this fundamental aspect of cognition using exemplars. Our evaluation reveals that some methods rely heavily on salient assumptions that are both questionable and almost impossible to verify in order to make a claim of transitive inference in animals. For example, we found shortcomings with most n-term task designs in that they often do not provide an explicit transitive relationship and/or and ordered set on which transitive inference can be performed. Consequently, they rely on supplementary assumptions to make a claim of transitive inference. However, as these assumptions are either impossible or are extremely difficult to validate in non-human animals, the results obtained using these specific n-term tasks cannot be taken as unambiguous demonstrations (or the lack thereof) of transitive inference. This realisation is one that is generally overlooked in the literature. In contrast, the associative transitivity task and the dominance relationship test both meet the criteria for transitive inference. However, although the dominance relationship test can disambiguate between transitive inference accounts and associative ones, the associative transitivity test cannot. Our evaluation also highlights the limitations and future challenges of current associative models of transitive inference. We propose three new experimental methods that can be applied within any theoretical framework to ensure that the experimental behaviour observed is indeed the result of transitive inference whilst removing the need for supplementary assumptions: the test for the opposite transitive relation, the discrimination test between two separate and previously non-reinforced items, and the control for absolute knowledge.},

Here we explored the role of the prefrontal cortex in transitive inference by examining the performance of mice with selective
damage to the medial prefrontal cortex. Damage to the infralimbic and prelimbic regions resulted in significant impairment
in the acquisition of a series of overlapping odor discrimination problems, such that animals with prefrontal lesions
required twice as many trials to learn compared to sham-operated controls. Following eventually successful acquisition,
animals with medial prefrontal lesions were severely impaired on a transitive inference probe test, whereas they performed
as well as controls on a test that involved a nontransitive judgment from a novel odor pairing. These results suggest that the

TI could be a useful tool for individuals living in large social groups, as these are confronted with an increasing number of possible dyadic relationships between group members. Through TI, one could potentially identify rank relationships between group members and thereby avoid costly direct agonistic interactions. Jackdaws seem ideal candidates to test for the ability of TI as they live in relatively complex groups, in which such skills could be useful. We presently report the results of jackdaws in a touch screen experiment. Three individuals were trained to memorise an ordered sequence of five differently coloured squares (A\textendash{}E), which were presented in four pairs consisting of two adjacent colours each (A/B, B/C, C/D, D/E). After reaching the pre-defined criteria in each single colour pair in a time comparable to other species, they were confronted with an unknown pair of two non-adjacent colours (B/D). The birds were able to identify the relationship according to the previously learned sequence by preferring B over D.},

	Abstract = {It is surprising that there are inconsistent findings of transitive inference (TI) in young infants given that non-linguistic species succeed on TI tests. To conclusively test for TI in infants, we developed a task within the social domain, with which infants are known to show sophistication. We familiarized 10- to 13-month-olds (M = 11.53 months) to a video of two dominance interactions between three puppets (bear {$>$} elephant; hippo {$>$} bear) consistent with a dominance hierarchy (hippo {$>$} bear {$>$} elephant; where `{$>$}' denotes greater dominance). Infants then viewed interactions between the two puppets that had not interacted during familiarization. These interactions were either congruent (hippo {$>$} elephant) or incongruent (elephant {$>$} hippo) with the inferred hierarchy. Consistent with TI, infants looked longer to incongruent than congruent displays. Control conditions ruled out the possibility that infants' expectations were based on stable behaviors specific to individual puppets rather than their inferred transitive dominance relations. We suggest that TI may be supported by phylogenetically ancient mechanisms of ordinal representation and visuospatial processing that come online early in human development.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference reasoning involves the examination and comparison of a given number of relational pairs in order to understand overall group hierarchy (e.g., A{$>$}B, B{$>$}C, C{$>$}D; therefore is A{$>$}D?). A number of imaging studies have demonstrated the role of the parietal cortex for resolving transitive inferences. Some studies also identify the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex as being critical for ``relational integration'' processes supporting transitive reasoning. To clarify this issue, we carried out a transitive inference study involving neurological patients with focal lesions to the rostrolateral prefrontal (n=5) or parietal cortices (n=7), as well as normal controls (n=6). The patients and controls were statistically matched on age, education, pre-injury IQ, general memory, working memory, and performance/full IQ, though the rostrolateral patients did score significantly higher than the normal controls on verbal IQ. Results indicate that patients with focal lesions to the parietal cortex were impaired in the task relative to both the patients with focal lesions to rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and the control group, and there was no difference in task performance between the rostrolateral prefrontal and the control groups. This result continued to hold after controlling for verbal IQ as a covariate. These findings point to a critical role for the parietal cortex, rather than the rostrolateral prefrontal, in transitive inference. Since the groups performed similarly on a working memory task, working memory cannot fully account for the result, suggesting a specific role of parietal cortex in transitive inference.},

	Abstract = {The use of reinforcement and rewards is known to enhance memory retention. However, the impact of reinforcement on higher-order forms of memory processing, such as integration and generalization, has not been directly manipulated in previous studies. Furthermore, there is evidence that sleep enhances the integration and generalization of memory, but these studies have only used reinforcement learning paradigms and have not examined whether reinforcement impacts or is critical for memory integration and generalization during sleep. Thus, the aims of the current study were to examine: (1) whether reinforcement during learning impacts the integration and generalization of memory; and (2) whether sleep and reinforcement interact to enhance memory integration and generalization. We investigated these questions using a transitive inference (TI) task, which is thought to require the integration and generalization of disparate relational memories in order to make novel inferences. To examine whether reinforcement influences or is required for the formation of inferences, we compared performance using a reinforcement or an observation based TI task. We examined the impact of sleep by comparing performance after a 12-h delay containing either wake or sleep. Our results showed that: (1) explicit reinforcement during learning is required to make transitive inferences and that sleep further enhances this effect; (2) sleep does not make up for the inability to make inferences when reinforcement does not occur during learning. These data expand upon previous findings and suggest intriguing possibilities for the mechanisms involved in sleep-dependent memory transformation.},

	Abstract = {We hypothesized that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is critical for making transitive inferences (e.g., the logical operation that if A {$>$} B and B {$>$} C, then A {$>$} C). To test this, participants with focal vmPFC damage, brain-damaged comparison participants, and neurologically normal participants completed a transitive inference task consisting of an ordered set of arbitrary patterns. Participants first learned through trial-and-error the relationships of the patterns (e.g., Pattern A {$>$} Pattern B, Pattern B {$>$} Pattern C). After initial learning, participants were presented with novel pairings, some of which required transitive inference (e.g., Pattern A {$>$} Pattern C from the relationship above). We observed that vmPFC damage led to a specific deficit in transitive inference, suggesting that an intact vmPFC is necessary for making normal transitive inferences. Given the usefulness of transitivity in inferring social relationships, this deficit may be one of the basic features of social conduct problems associated with vmPFC damage.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) occurs when information about known relationships is used to construct novel associations, for example,
when an individual infers the order of 3 conspecifics in a linear dominance hierarchy (A {$>$} B {$>$} C) by watching 2 dyads (A {$>$} B
and B {$>$} C). TI has been demonstrated for several species, but never for organisms with hierarchies involving many individuals
whose rank order changes often. Under these circumstances, theory predicts natural selection may favor use of explicit cues to
rank conspecifics, rather than TI. Here we show that brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), a species that exhibits complex, shifting
dominance hierarchies, can combine individual recognition and TI to rank individuals within a hierarchy without use of explicit
cues. Subjects that were allowed to directly interact with rivals were able to identify the social rank of each individual. In addition,
we found that a subject, whose rank was C within a 5-fish hierarchy (A {$>$} B {$>$} C {$>$} D {$>$} E), could use TI to correctly infer the
ranks of A and E after first interacting with B and D and then watching dyads involving A {$>$} B and D {$>$} E. This demonstration of
TI in brook trout contributes to the understanding of stream trout population dynamics as TI could lower the energetic costs
associated with movement. Key words: brook trout, individual recognition, social learning, transitive inference.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive abilities are impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders, including
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Preclinical
models with strong endophenotypes relevant to cognitive
dysfunctions offer a valuable resource for therapeutic development.
However, improved assays to test higher order cognition are needed.
We employed touchscreen technology to design a complex transitive
inference (TI) assay that requires cognitive flexibility and relational
learning. C57BL/6J (B6) mice with good cognitive skills and BTBR T
+tf/J (BTBR), a model of ASD with cognitive deficits, were evaluated
in simple and complex touchscreen assays. Both B6 and BTBR
acquired visual discrimination and reversal. BTBR displayed deficits
on components of TI, when 4 stimuli pairs were interspersed, which
required flexible integrated knowledge. BTBR displayed impairment
on the A{$>$}E inference, analogous to the A{$>$}E deficit in ASD. B6
and BTBR mice both reached criterion on the B{$>$}D comparison,
unlike the B{$>$}D impairment in schizophrenia. These results demonstrate
that mice are capable of complex discriminations and higher
order tasks using methods and equipment paralleling those used in
humans. Our discovery that a mouse model of ASD displays a TI
deficit similar to humans with ASD supports the use of the touchscreen
technology for complex cognitive tasks in mouse models of
neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference problems were presented in a modified conclusion evaluation procedure. Conclusions were believable or unbelievable and valid, invalid, or indeterminate. The 67 undergraduate students read the premises, evaluated the conclusions (accept, reject, cannot tell), then provided confidence ratings. Fluid intelligence was also assessed. Acceptance of valid conclusions, rejection of invalid conclusions, and cannot tell responses to indeterminate conclusions of non-integrable problems indicated use of analytic processing. Believability effects indicated use of heuristic processing. Fluid intelligence and premise integration ability (non-integrable problems) predicted greater use of analytic processing on valid and invalid problems. Premise integration ability was associated with reduced belief bias on invalid problems. Premise integration ability appears to influence the extent of heuristic versus analytic processing. Confidence was sensitive to the presence of belief-logic conflict. Conflict detection scores reflecting this sensitivity were not associated with analytic processing suggesting that conflict detection occurs automatically and reflects an intuitive logic.},

	Abstract = {A typical nonverbal transitive inference task (TI) consists of several overlapping discriminations (A+ B-, B+ C-, C+ D-, D+ E-, where letters indicate stimuli and pluses and minuses denote reinforcement and nonreinforcement). A choice of stimulus B in a novel pair BD is interpreted as indicative of a TI (if B {$>$} C and C {$>$} D, then B {$>$} D). Although hippocampus has been implicated in nonverbal TI, it is not clear whether it simply maintains memory of associative values or stores an ordered representation of stimuli. We investigated the effect of hippocampal lesion on TI in pigeons while controlling reinforcement history so that reliance on associative values would lead to a choice of a stimulus D in the pair BD instead of a choice of a stimulus B expected by inferential mechanisms. Prior to the lesion, some of the pigeons (relational group; n = 4) have selected B over D indicating TI, while other birds (associative group; n = 6) chose D over B suggesting reliance on associative values. Hippocampal lesion had no effect on postlesion performance in associative group. In contrast, the relational group that preferred stimulus B in a pair BD prior to lesion showed a near-chance performance after the lesion. Our results demonstrate that hippocampus may be involved in creating a representation of an ordered series of the stimuli instead of maintaining reinforcement history of each stimulus. In addition, we provide a behavioral procedure suitable for dissociating different behavioral strategies used to solving TI task. Finally, we show for the first time the involvement of avian hippocampus in the task that is not explicitly spatial in nature. These results further confirm the notion that avian hippocampus is functionally analogous to mammalian hippocampus despite the significant differences in their anatomy.},

	Abstract = {Transfer learning, which leverages knowledge from source domains to enhance learning ability in a target domain, has been proven effective in various applications. A major limitation of transfer learning is that the source and target domains should be directly related. If there is little overlap between the two domains, performing knowledge transfer between these domains will not be effective. Inspired by human transitive inference and learning ability, whereby two seemingly unrelated concepts can be connected by series of intermediate bridges using auxiliary concepts, in this paper we study a novel learning problem: Transitive Transfer Learning (abbreviated to TTL). TTL is aimed at breaking the large domain distances and transferring knowledge even when the source and target domains share few factors directly. For example, when the source and target domains are text and images respectively, TTL can use some annotated images as the intermediate domain to bridge them. To solve the TTL problem, we propose a framework wherein we first select one or more domains to act as a bridge between the source and target domains to enable transfer learning, and then perform the transferring of knowledge via this bridge. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the framework yields state-of-the-art classification accuracies on several classification data sets.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies static and dynamic decentralized versions of the search model known as cellular genetic algorithm (cGA), in which individuals are located in a specific topology and interact only with their neighbors. Making changes in the shape of such topology or in the neighborhood may give birth to a high number of algorithmic variants. We perform these changes in a methodological way by tuning the concept of ratio. Since the relationship (ratio) between the topology and the neighborhood shape defines the search selection pressure, we propose to analyze in depth the influence of this ratio on the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. As we will see, it is difficult to decide which ratio is best suited for a given problem. Therefore, we introduce a preprogrammed change of this ratio during the evolution as a possible additional improvement that removes the need of specifying a single ratio. A later refinement will lead us to the first adaptive dynamic kind of cellular models to our knowledge.

In particular, how do subjects, given a set of particular examples, generate general descriptions of the rules governing that set? We present a biologically plausible method for accomplishing this task and implement it in a spiking neuron model. We demonstrate the success of this model by applying it to the problem domain of Raven's Progressive Matrices, a widely used tool in the field of intelligence testing. The model is able to generate the rules necessary to correctly solve Raven's items, as well as recreate many of the experimental effects observed in human subjects.},

	Abstract = {The integration of multiple relations between mental representations is critical for higher level cognition. For both deductiveand inductive-reasoning tasks, patients with prefrontal damage exhibited a selective and catastrophic deficit in the integration of relations, whereas patients with anterior temporal lobe damage, matched for overall IQ but with intact prefrontal cortex, exhibited normal relational integration. In contrast, prefrontal patients performed more accurately than temporal patients on tests of both episodic memory and semantic knowledge. These double dissociations suggest that integration of relations is a specific source of cognitive complexity for which intact prefrontal cortex is essential. The integration of relations may be the fundamental common factor linking the diverse abilities that depend on prefrontal function, such as planning, problem solving, and fluid intelligence.},

	Abstract = {Much of cognitive research on deductive reasoning has been preoccupied with advocating for or against visuospatial (mental model theory) or linguistic/syntactic (mental logic theory) models of logical reasoning. Neuroimaging studies bear on this issue by pointing to both language-based and visuospatial systems being engaged during logical reasoning, and by raising additional issues not anticipated by these cognitive theories. Here, the literature on the neural basis of deductive reasoning from the past decade is reviewed. Although these results might seem chaotic and inconsistent, we identify several interesting patterns and articulate their implications for cognitive theories of reasoning. Cognitive neuroscience data point away from a unitary system for logical reasoning and towards a fractionated system dynamically reconfigured in response to specific task and environmental cues.},

	Abstract = {Research from ethology and evolutionary biology indicates the following about the evolution of reasoning capacity. First, solving problems of social competition and cooperation have direct impact on survival rates and reproductive success. Second, the social structure that evolved from this pressure is the dominance hierarchy. Third, primates that live in large groups with complex dominance hierarchies also show greater neocortical development, and concomitantly greater cognitive capacity. These facts suggest that the necessity of reasoning effectively about dominance hierarchies left an mdelible mark on primate reasoning architectures, including that of humans. In order to survive in a dominance hierarchy, an individual must be capable of (a) making rank discriminations, (b) recognizing what is forbidden and what is permitted based one's rank, and (c) deciding whether to engage in or refrain from activities that will allow one to move up in rank. The first problem is closely tied to the capacity for transitive reasoning, while the second and third are intimately related to the capacity for deontic reasoning. I argue that the human capacity for these types of reasoning have evolutionary roots that reach deeper into our ancestral past than the emergence of the hominid line, and the operation of these evolutionarily primitive reasoning systems can be seen in the development of human reasoning and domain-specific effects in adult reasoning.},

Our results showed that infants found it harder to memorize dominance relations that were presented in an order that hindered the incremental formation of a single structure (Study 1). These results suggest that infants attempt to build structures incrementally, relation by relation, thereby simplifying the complex problem of recognizing a social structure. Infants also found circular dominance structures harder to process than linear dominance structures (Study 2). These expectations about the shape of structures may facilitate learning. Our results suggest that infants attempt to represent social structures composed of social relations. They indicate that human infants go beyond learning about individual social partners and their respective relations and form hypotheses about how social groups are organized.},

	Abstract = {Previous imaging studies have identified many brain regions activated during reasoning, but there are differences among the findings concerning specific regions engaged in reasoning and the contribution of language areas. Also, little is known about the relation between task complexity and neural activation during reasoning. The present fMRI study investigated brain activity during complex four-term transitive reasoning with abstract material (determinate or partially indeterminate) and compared the resulting images to those obtained during a memorization task. The memory condition required subjects to memorize unrelated elements whereas the reasoning conditions required them to integrate information from premises and to infer relations between elements. After contrasting the two kinds of reasoning conditions with the memory condition we found that right prefrontal and bilateral parietal regions are specifically activated during reasoning. We also demonstrated that different reasoning requirements \textendash{} the possibility of constructing one (determined reasoning) versus several (undetermined reasoning) models of a situation during task solving \textendash{} lead to different patterns of brain activity, with higher prefrontal (PFC) activity accompanying undetermined reasoning. We interpret the PFC activity as a reflection of simultaneous maintenance and manipulation of information in reasoning. These findings provide new evidence that specific forms of reasoning (abstract and undetermined) demand recruitment of right PFC and hemispheric coordination and lend new support to the mental model theory of relational reasoning.},

	Abstract = {Relational reasoning is an essential component of fluid intelligence, and is known to have a protracted developmental trajectory. To date, little is known about the neural changes that underlie improvements in reasoning ability over development. In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, children aged 8\textendash{}12 and adults aged 18\textendash{}25 performed a relational reasoning task adapted from Raven's Progressive Matrices. The task included three levels of relational reasoning demands: REL-0, REL-1, and REL-2. Children exhibited disproportionately lower accuracy than adults on trials that required integration of two relations (REL-2). Like adults, children engaged lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal cortex during task performance; however, they exhibited different time courses and activation profiles, providing insight into their approach to the problems. As in prior studies, adults exhibited increased rostrolateral PFC (RLPFC) activation when relational integration was required (REL-2 {$>$} REL-1, REL-0). Children also engaged RLPFC most strongly for REL-2 problems at early stages of processing, but this differential activation relative to REL-1 trials was not sustained throughout the trial. These results suggest that the children recruited RLPFC while processing relations, but failed to use it to integrate across two relations. Relational integration is critical for solving a variety of problems, and for appreciating analogies; the current findings suggest that developmental improvements in this function rely on changes in the profile of engagement of RLPFC, as well as dorsolateral PFC and parietal cortex.},

	Abstract = {On close examination of research programs which focus, either implicitly or explicitly, on the problem of the organisation of serial order in non-human primates, it is possible to detect some limitations in the paradigms conventionally used. Serial learning studies, which focus on the acquisition of arbitrary lists of unconnected elements point towards a distinction between the representation of ordered series formed by monkeys and pigeons. However, the use of unconnected items prevents an assay of the degree to which primates might be able to impose a structure over the list to be reported. The study of transitive reasoning has been implemented by means of a paradigm where the order of a series is conveyed by presenting a common item in pairs of binary discriminations. Animals tested with this paradigm develop control strategies using more information than that provided by reward contingencies alone. A restriction of this paradigm is that, in its binary form, it does not allow a differentiation between the performance of monkeys and pigeons and even simple models account for a transitive bias in the task. On the basis of these observations it is proposed that novel paradigms which go beyond the binary context, feature multiple connected items, and accord a high degree of spontaneity to the subjects might allow better than traditional ones to uncover qualitative different ways in which different organisms serially organise their behaviour. Some recent research programs based on such rationale, and implemented as search tasks, are then outlined and compared with other approaches to the study of search behaviour. Preliminary results obtained from these studies indicate that the spontaneous serial organisation of multiple connected items might uncover new dimensions of promising comparative relevance.},

Method: We analyzed the performance of a group of children with ADHD during a transitive inference task, a task requiring first to learn the reciprocal relationship between adjacent items of a rank ordered series (e.g., A{$>$}B; B{$>$}C; C{$>$}D; D{$>$}E; E{$>$}F), and second, to deduct the relationship between novel pairs of items never matched during the learning (e.g., B{$>$}D; C{$>$}E). Results: As a main result, we observed that children with ADHD were impaired in performing inferential reasoning problems. The deficit in relational reasoning was found to be related to the difficulty in managing a unified representation of ordered items. Conclusion: The present finding documented a novel deficit in ADHD, contributing to improving the understanding of the disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Understanding the factors that shape the social landscape is essential for living in a group, where dominant individuals often have greater control over and access to desired resources such as food and mates. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that preverbal infants, similar to their nonhuman primate relatives, already possess the cognitive schemas necessary to represent social dominance in relationships, using ecologically relevant cues such as relative physical size and group size. In this article, we discuss the phylogenetic and ontogenetic origins of infants' and children's capacity to represent social dominance in relationships and hierarchies, and examine how these initial representations are enriched across early childhood.},

	Abstract = {The psychology of reasoning is currently transitioning from the study of deductive inferences under certainty to inferences that have degrees of uncertainty in both their premises and conclusions; however, only a few studies have explored the cortical basis of uncertain reasoning. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we show that areas in the right superior parietal lobe (rSPL) are necessary for solving spatial relational reasoning problems under conditions of uncertainty. Twenty-four participants had to decide whether a single presented order of objects agreed with a given set of indeterminate premises that could be interpreted in more than one way. During the presentation of the order, 10-Hz TMS was applied over the rSPL or a sham control site. Right SPL TMS during the inference phase disrupted performance in uncertain relational reasoning. Moreover, we found differences in the error rates between preferred mental models, alternative models, and inconsistent models. Our results suggest that different mechanisms are involved when people reason spatially and evaluate different kinds of uncertain conclusions.},

	Abstract = {A probabilistic causal chain A\textrightarrowB\textrightarrowC may intuitively appear to be transitive: If A probabilistically causes B, and B probabilistically causes C, A probabilistically causes C. However, probabilistic causal relations can only guaranteed to be transitive if the so-called Markov condition holds. In two experiments, we examined how people make probabilistic judgments about indirect relationships A\textrightarrowC in causal chains A\textrightarrowB\textrightarrowC that violate the Markov condition. We hypothesized that participants would make transitive inferences in accordance with the Markov condition although they were presented with counterevidence showing intransitive data. For instance, participants were successively presented with data entailing positive dependencies A\textrightarrowB and B\textrightarrowC. At the same time, the data entailed that A and C were statistically independent. The results of two experiments show that transitive reasoning via a mediating event B influenced and distorted the induction of the indirect relation between A and C. Participants' judgments were affected by an interaction of transitive, causal-model-based inferences and the observed data. Our findings support the idea that people tend to chain individual causal relations into mental causal chains that obey the Markov condition and thus allow for transitive reasoning, even if the observed data entail that such inferences are not warranted.},

	Abstract = {How does the brain represent a newly-learned mental model? Representational similarity analysis (RSA) has revealed the neural basis of common representational spaces learned early in development, such as categories of natural kinds. This study uses RSA to examine the neural implementation of a newly-learned mental model\textendash{}i.e., a representational space created through deductive reasoning\textendash{}and study the structure of previously found parietal activity in reasoning tasks. Specifically, all the information in this mental model could only be obtained through abstract transitive reasoning, as there were no predictive differences between observable features in the stimuli, and stimuli were counterbalanced across participants. Participants were shown unfamiliar face portraits paired with names and asked to learn about the height of each person pictured in the portraits through comparison to other individuals in the set. Participants learned the relative heights only of adjacent pairs in the set and then used transitive reasoning to generate a linear ranking of heights (e.g., ``Matthew is taller than Thomas; Thomas is taller than Andrew; therefore Matthew is taller than Andrew''). During fMRI, participants recalled the approximate height of each individual based on these inferences. Using a predictive model based on the relative heights of the set of individuals, RSA revealed three brain regions in the right hemisphere that encoded this newly-learned representational space, located within the intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, and inferior frontal gyrus. These findings demonstrate the value of RSA for analyzing structure within patterns of activity and support theories asserting that logical reasoning recruits spatial processing mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Relational reasoning, or the ability to integrate multiple mental relations to arrive at a logical conclusion, is a critical component of higher cognition. A bilateral brain network involving lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices has been consistently implicated in relational reasoning. Some data suggest a preferential role for the left hemisphere in this form of reasoning, whereas others suggest that the two hemispheres make important contributions. To test for a hemispheric asymmetry in relational reasoning, we made use of an old technique known as visual half-field stimulus presentation to manipulate whether stimuli were presented briefly to one hemisphere or the other. Across two experiments, 54 neurologically healthy young adults performed a visuospatial transitive inference task. Pairs of colored shapes were presented rapidly in either the left or right visual hemifield as participants maintained central fixation, thereby isolating initial encoding to the contralateral hemisphere. We observed a left-hemisphere advantage for encoding a series of ordered visuospatial relations, but both hemispheres contributed equally to task performance when the relations were presented out of order. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal hemispheric differences in relational encoding in the intact brain. We discuss these findings in the context of a rich literature on hemispheric asymmetries in cognition.},

Humans can learn about the linear order within groups using reasoning, and the success of such reasoning may vary according to affective state, such as depression.

Using BDI-II criteria, 14 non-depressed and 12 mildly depressed volunteers took part in a linear-order reasoning task during fMRI. The hippocampus, parietal and prefrontal cortices were activated during the task, in accordance with previous studies. In the learning phase and in the test phase, greater activation of the parietal cortex was found in the depressed group, which may be a compensatory mechanism in order to reach the same behavioural performance as the non-depressed group, or evidence for a different reasoning strategy in the depressed group.},

	Abstract = {Causal reasoning is crucial to people's decision making in probabilistic environments. It may rely directly on data about covariation between variables (correspondence) or on inferences based on reasonable constraints if larger causal models are constructed based on local relations (coherence). For causal chains an often assumed constraint is transitivity. For probabilistic causal relations, mismatches between such transitive inferences and direct empirical evidence may lead to distortions of empirical evidence. Previous work has shown that people may use the generative local causal relations A \textrightarrow B and B \textrightarrow C to infer a positive indirect relation between events A and C, despite data showing that these events are actually independent (von Sydow et al. in Proceedings of the thirty-first annual conference of the cognitive science society.

Cognitive Science Society, Austin, 2010, Mem Cogn 44(3):469\textendash{}487, 2016). Here we used a sequential learning scenario to investigate how transitive reasoning in intransitive situations with negatively related distal events may relate to betting behavior. In three experiments participants bet as if they were influenced by a transitivity assumption, even when the data strongly contradicted transitivity.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) is the ability to infer the relationship between items (e.g., A{$>$}C) after having learned a set of premise pairs (e.g., A{$>$}B and B{$>$}C). Previous studies in humans have identified a distributed neural network, including cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, during TI judgments. We studied two aspects of TI using fMRI of subjects who had acquired the 6-item sequence (A{$>$}B{$>$}C{$>$}D{$>$}E{$>$}F) of visual stimuli. First, the identification of novel pairs not containing end items (i.e., B{$>$}D, C{$>$}E, B{$>$}E) was associated with greater left hippocampal activation when compared to the identification of novel pairs containing end items A and F. This demonstrates that the identification of stimulus pairs requiring the flexible representation of a sequence is associated with hippocampal activation., Second, for the three novel pairs devoid of end items we found greater right hippocampal activation for pairs B{$>$}D and C{$>$}E compared with pair B{$>$}E. This indicates that TI decisions on pairs derived from more adjacent items in the sequence are associated with greater hippocampal activation. Hippocampal activation thus scales with the degree of relational processing necessary for TI judgments., Both findings confirm a role of the hippocampus in transitive inference in humans.},

	Abstract = {For about two decades now, the localization of the brain regions involved in reasoning processes is being investigated through fMRI studies, and it is known that for a transitive form of reasoning the frontal and parietal regions are most active. In contrast, less is known about the information exchange during the performance of such complex tasks. In this study, the propagation of brain activity during a transitive reasoning task was investigated and compared to the propagation during a simple memory task. We studied EEG transmission patterns obtained for physiological indicators of brain activity and determined whether there are frequency bands specifically related to this type of cognitive operations. The analysis was performed by means of the directed transfer function. The transmission patterns were determined in the theta, alpha and gamma bands. The results show stronger transmissions in theta and alpha bands from frontal to parietal as well as within frontal regions in reasoning trials comparing to memory trials. The increase in theta and alpha transmissions was accompanied by flows in gamma band from right posterior to left posterior and anterior sites. These results are consistent with previous neuroimaging (fMRI) data concerning fronto-parietal regions involvement in reasoning and working memory processes and also provide new evidence for the executive role of frontal theta waves in organizing the cognition.},

	Abstract = {Non-linear changes in behaviour and in brain activity during adolescent development have been reported in a variety of cognitive tasks. These developmental changes are often interpreted as being a consequence of changes in brain structure, including nonlinear changes in grey matter volumes, which occur during adolescence. However, very few studies have attempted to combine behavioural, functional and structural data. This multi-method approach is the one we took in the current study, which was designed to investigate developmental changes in behaviour and brain activity during relational reasoning, the simultaneous integration of multiple relations. We used a relational reasoning task known to recruit rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC), a region that undergoes substantial structural changes during adolescence. The task was administered to female participants in a behavioural (N = 178, 7\textendash{}27 years) and an fMRI study (N = 37, 11\textendash{}30 years). Non-linear changes in accuracy were observed, with poorer performance during mid-adolescence. fMRI and VBM results revealed a complex picture of linear and possibly nonlinear changes with age. Performance and structural changes partly accounted for changes with age in RLPFC and medial superior frontal gyrus activity but not for a decrease in activation in the anterior insula {$\fracslash$} frontal operculum between midadolescence and adulthood. These functional changes might instead reflect the maturation of neurocognitive strategies.},

	Abstract = {Trust transitivity is a common phenomenon embedded in human reasoning about trust. Given a specific context or purpose, trust transitivity is often manifested through the humans' intuition to rely on the recommendations of a trustworthy advisor about another entity that the advisor recommends. Although this simple principle has been formalised in various ways for many trust and reputation systems, there is no real or physical basis for trust transitivity to be directly translated into a mathematical model. In that sense, all mathematical operators for trust transitivity proposed in the literature must be considered ad hoc; they represent attempts to model a very complex human phenomenon as if it were lendable to analysis by the laws of physics. Considering this nature of human trust transitivity in reality, any simple mathematical model will essentially have rather poor predictive power. In this paper, we propose a new interpretation of trust transitivity that is radically different from those described in the literature so far. More specifically, we consider recommendations from an advisor as evidence that the relying party will use as input arguments in conditional reasoning models for assessing hypotheses about the trust target.

	Abstract = {Deductive reasoning is traditionally viewed as a unitary process involving either rule-based or visuo-spatial mechanisms. However, there is a disagreement in the neuroimaging literature on whether the data support one alternative over the other. Here we test the hypothesis that discrepancies in the literature result from the reasoning materials themselves. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measure brain activity of participants while they integrate the premises of conditional arguments (primarily Modus Tollens: If P then Q; not-Q) and Relational Syllogisms (i.e., linear arguments of the sort P is to the left of Q; Q is to the left of R). We find that reasoning with Modus Tollens activates the left inferior frontal gyrus to a greater extent than the Relational Syllogisms. In contrast, the Relational Syllogisms engage the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction more than conditional arguments. This suggests that conditional reasoning relies more on so-called syntactic processes than relational reasoning, while relational reasoning may rely on visuo-spatial processes and mental imagery more than conditional reasoning. This investigative approach, together with its results, clarifies some apparently inconsistent findings in this literature by showing that the nature of the logical argument, whether it is relational or conditional, determines which neural system is engaged.},

@article{anderson1998,
	Abstract = {Working memory limits are best defined in terms of the complexity of the relations that can be processed in parallel. Complexity is defined as the number of related dimensions or sources of variation. A unary relation has one argument and one source of variation; its argument can be instantiated in only one way at a time. A binary relation has two arguments, two sources of variation, and two instantiations, and so on. Dimensionality is related to the number of chunks, because both attributes on dimensions and chunks are independent units of information of arbitrary size. Studies of working memory limits suggest that there is a soft limit corresponding to the parallel processing of one quaternary relation. More complex concepts are processed by ``segmentation'' or ``conceptual chunking.'' In segmentation, tasks are broken into components that do not exceed processing capacity and can be processed serially. In conceptual chunking, representations are ``collapsed'' to reduce their dimensionality and hence their processing load, but at the cost of making some relational information inaccessible. Neural net models of relational representations show that relations with more arguments have a higher computational cost that coincides with experimental findings on higher processing loads in humans. Relational complexity is related to processing load in reasoning and sentence comprehension and can distinguish between the capacities of higher species. The complexity of relations processed by children increases with age. Implications for neural net models and theories of cognition and cognitive development are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments tested a conjecture that a common representation, a linear order, underlies the processing of all comparatives. In Expt I, third-grade children learned the relations between adjacent pairs in a series of six faces and were tested on all possible pairs, using comparisons of height, weight, happiness, and niceness. Both the serial position effect in training and an inverse relationship between decision time and number of inferential steps in testing supported the hypothesis that linear orders were constructed from the pairwise relations. When allowed to organize a second set of faces as an external mnemonic, children constructed linear orders and training was dramatically facilitated. In Expt II, children who were shown nonlinear displays of pairs constructed linear memory representations in a task where memory was not required. The data strongly suggest that (a) linear orders are a common mode of representation for comparative relations, (b) people use these ordered sets to draw inferences about members of the set, and (c) formal deductive logic may not characterize the processes used by children to draw transitive inferences.},

Mary is taller than Pete. Who is tallest? John, Mary, Pete.'' Response latencies and error rates decreased across grade levels and sessions. Component latencies also generally decreased with increasing age. Four alternative information-processing models were fit to the group latency data at each grade level. These models were (a) a spatial model, according to which people represent the terms of a linear syllogism in the form of a linear spatial array; (b) a linguistic model, according to which linear syllogisms are solved via inferences on functional relations represented by linguistic deep structures; (c) an algorithmic model, according to which people solve linear syllogisms by applying a series of simple, essentially mechanical steps, and (d) a mixed model, which combines selected features of the spatial and linguistic models, and adds new features of its own. The latency data supported the mixed model at each grade level, although in grade 9 the model was not the preferred one until the second session of testing.},

Evidence for this phenomenon, here called the symbolic distance effect, is reviewed, and the paper describes a new experiment designed to clarify the nature of the effective ``distance'' by disentangling ordinal and interval distances between the referents of compared symbols. The data show that doubling the size difference between two circles speeds comparison of their names, even when ordinal distance between the circles is held constant. Several explanations of the mental processes involved in such memory comparisons are then critically evaluated, and a ``scan plus comparison'' model is tentatively adopted.},

	Abstract = {Forty-eight second graders (8 years of age) were trained on length or weight relationships between adjacent members of a five-term series of colored objects. Feedback was visual and of either minimal or strong salience. Differences in weight were assessed by either a balance scale or a spring scale. Results showed that more salient visual feedback reduced the learning effort for length but not for weight comparisons. After training children were tested on all possible object pairs. Children's comparisons of items by length were very accurate in contrast to their comparisons by weight. An explanation for these findings is suggested by the data from a group of 6-year-olds who were trained on two independent pairs of a four-term series. Test results showed that subjects spontaneously encoded absolute lengths but tended to ignore information about the absolute weight of objects. It is suggested that high test accuracy depends on stimulus material for which the absolute values of the relevant dimension are encoded. The implications for taking test performance as an indicator of ``transitive reasoning'' ability are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Our first experiment provided evidence for the view that visual feedback in transitive reasoning tasks of the Bryant \& Trabasso (1971) variety results in graded linear encoding of the length series whereas linguistic feedback results in dichotomous encoding. When 6\textendash{}8-year-old children had to tackle transitive tasks in which the visual formation of a graded series was impossible (e.g. A {$>$} B, N {$>$} A, B {$>$} N) the performance was more disrupted under conditions of visual than under conditions of linguistic feedback. In a second experiment with 6- and 8-year-olds it was found that high test accuracy does not depend on perceiving actual lengths (visual feedback) but can also be induced through linguistic feedback by providing a procedural cue to gradations. The cue provided was the ratio of occasions on which a stick was described as being `longer' than the comparison stick to occasions on which it was described as being `shorter'. The procedure adopted during training was designed so that these ratios corresponded to the relative lengths of the sticks.},

Our aim was to discover whether they could work out that A must be in a higher position than C, if A is above B and B above C. Our technique was to show children three or more `premise' towers, each consisting of two bricks of different colours and to ask the children to build a larger tower which preserved the spatial relationships of the colours in the premise towers. So, if the child saw three premise towers, and in one red was above blue, in another blue above green and in the third green above yellow, s/he would have to build a red above blue above green above yellow tower. Before the child built the larger tower, we posed inferential questions about the relation of bricks in that tower: e.g. which would be in the higher position, red or green? We gave problems with three, four and five premise towers to 58 four-year-old children. They were able to make transitive inferences about spatial position with considerable success.},

There was a marked improvement in the mastery of the middle concept across elementary school grades. Asking the child to point to the middle "dimension label" (e.g., middle oval) facilitated performance when compared to asking the child to point to the middle thing. In Experiment 2, second- through fifth-grade children were pretrained to choose the middle item associated with a single set of three stimuli, two sets of three stimuli representing the same dimension, or two sets of three stimuli with each set representing a different dimension. Transfer to six novel test dimensions was evaluated. Pretraining with two rather than one stimulus set transferred to the novel test dimensions. The results were related to induction and transposition theories and to issues concerning implicit and explicit learning.},

	Abstract = {The neural basis of developmental changes in transitive reasoning in parietal regions was examined, using voxel-based morphometry. Young adolescents and adults performed a transitive reasoning task, subsequent to undergoing anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. Behaviorally, adults reasoned more accurately than did the young adolescents. Neural results showed (i) less grey matter density in superior parietal cortex in the adults than in the young adolescents, possibly due to a developmental period of synaptic pruning; (ii) improved performance in the reasoning task was negatively correlated with grey matter density in superior parietal cortex in the adolescents, but not in the adult group; and (iii) the latter results were driven by the more difficult trials, requiring greater spatial manipulation. Taken together, the results support the idea that during development, regions in superior parietal cortex are fine-tuned, to support more robust spatial manipulation, resulting in greater accuracy and efficiency in transitive reasoning.},

	Abstract = {We report a formal model of transitive inference based on protocols from experiments on squirrel monkeys solving the 5-term series problem (McGonigle \& Chalmers, 1977, 1992). These studies generate databases featuring transitive choice, task transfer (where at first a significant decrement is observed, and later substantial improvement without explicit training), and, finally, a Symbolic Distance Effect (SDE) based on decision-time data. Using a rule-based (production) system, we first established rule stacks at the group, then at the individual level, on the basis of triadic transfer performance first recorded in the McGonigle and Chalmers (1977) study. The models for each subject then accommodated data from the more intensive, later study with the same subjects (McGonigle \& Chalmers, 1992). We found the initial model capable of dealing with all choice and reaction-time phenomena reported thus far, with only small changes in a rule search procedure. In common with an independent assay by McGonigle and Chalmers (1992), our model-based reassessment of decision times indicates that a major source of reaction time variation is item prominence in the rule stack rather than interitem (ordinal) distance per se.},

	Abstract = {The study compared the performance of a group of congenitally blind children and two groups of sighted children, one of which was blindfolded and the other, visually informed. All the three groups were compared on a set of tasks, most of which have been used repeatedly to differentiate between the two developmental levels found to correspond roughly to the period of post-infancy, early childhood and middle childhood, respectively. The purpose was to test whether: (a) There is a developmental difference reflected in the performance of the blind group and the extent to which such a difference, if any, parallels that of the sighted groups. (b) There is any global or task specific cognition deficit in the blind group as compared to the sighted groups. (c) There is any difference in the performance of the sighted groups who undertook the tasks either visually or factually. Results indicate that cognitive development in the blind is not identical to that in sighted groups. Moreover, the differences in performance between groups are content or task specific and do not take the form of a global deficit across all developmental tasks. Furthermore, performance deficits are a function of both long-term absence of experience and absence of direct or immediate visual information about the stimulus at hand.},

Psychological research on the child's development of seriation has uncovered both cognitive stages and perceptual constraints. A generative connectionist algorithm, cascadecorrelation, is used to successfully model these psychological regularities. Previous rule-based models of seriation have been unable to capture either stage progressions or perceptual effects. The present simulations provide a number of insights about possible processing mechanisms for seriation, the nature of seriation stage transitions, and the opportunities provided by the environment for learning about seriation.  Introduction  Recent research has indicated that basic phenomena in cognitive development can be successfully modeled with connectionist networks (cf. reviews by Bates \& Elman, 1992; Plunkett \& Sinha, 1992; Shultz, 1991).

In Exp 2, numerals 1\textendash{}5 served as stimuli. One chimpanzee reliably selected the larger numeral 4 during testing with a nonadjacent pair (2\textendash{}4), and 2 chimps showed no preference. In a 2nd phase, the same chimp demonstrated proficiency at reversing the task, reliably selecting the smaller of the 2\textendash{}4 pair. In Exp 4, after additional training, a 2nd test, which included novel test pairs composed of numbers that had not been used during training, was completed. Two of 3 animals were 100\% correct on Trial 1 for all novel pairs. The results suggest that chimpanzees with experience in number concepts may recognize the ordinal character of numbers.

Compared to intellectually average children of similar MAs, retarded Ss took longer to learn the initial discriminations. However, their performance on tests for transitivity was above chance with the majority of the Ss perfect, and overall performance being slightly lower than that of intellectually average Ss. Memory for the initial comparisons was highly correlated with performance on transitivity, suggesting that a failure to make a transitive inference may be a result of a failure to retrieve the initial comparisons and not a failure to reason logically.

Indeed, the fundamental postulate that is the basis of the ideas summarized here is that the same problems and the same types of explanations can be found in the three following processes: a. The adaptation of an organism to its environment during its growth, together with the interactions and autoregulations which characterize the development of the ``epigenetic system.'' (Epigenesis in its embryologic sense is always determined both internally and externally.) b. The adaptation of intelligence in the course of the construction of its own structures, which depends as much on progressive internal coordinations as on information acquired through experience. c. The establishment of cognitive or, more generally, epistemological relations, which consist neither of a simple copy of external objects nor of a mere unfolding of structures preformed inside the subject, but rather involve a set of structures progressively constructed by continuous interaction between the subject and the external world.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new analysis of generative performances derived from contingencies that establish the production of stimulus sequences. Neither simple chaining nor within-sequence conditional stimulus control can account for the production of novel, untrained sequences that have been the outcomes of a number of experiments. The alternative analysis we propose focuses on relations among stimuli within sequences and across sequences trained independently of one another, and behavioral tests that evaluate whether such relations possess the properties of an order relation (i.e., asymmetry, transitivity, and connectedness). Our approach is an extension of Sidman's analysis of relations among stimuli in equivalence classes. It provides a framework for examining how equivalence and order relations interact to yield extensive repertoires of novel behaviors that occur under appropriate circumstances. The concepts and procedures we present outline a behavior analytic approach to studying aspects of phenomena like syntactic development and transitive inference.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the role that ``nonlogical'' cues might play in transitive inference, 6- and 7-year-olds were given a three-term transitive task in which perceptual cues to differential absolute size were either present or absent. Relationships between the taught premises and the relational information that was physically present were manipulated using four basic conditions: ``congruent,'' ``inverse,'' ``pretended,'' or ``persuaded.'' Both age groups showed identical overall premise memory, but the younger group tended to reason more on the basis of the perceptual information rather than on the successfully encoded premise information. Contrasts between the various conditions showed that categorical effects can be circumvented in three-term problems with appropriate controls, that there may be qualitative as well as quantitative differences in transitive inference with age, and that transitive inference is not based solely on memory. The findings also indicate that, although 7-year-olds are competent in ``logic-based'' transitive inference, they experience great difficulty on tasks involving pretend information.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) plays a part in many aspects of reasoning, and is usually assessed using variants on a particular task dubbed the ``IP-paradigm''. Advocates of this paradigm assume it ensures that subjects must use deduction to solve the inferential questions. The present task with 63 adults strengthened this claim by removing all possible perceptual cues and limiting as far as possible all cues from the training procedure itself. Response speed and accuracy were measured as premises were learned. Findings show that when over-training and non-logical cues are avoided, adults nevertheless reach high levels of overall performance. However, key indexes of Lexical Marking, Relative-End-Anchoring, and Symbolic Distance are largely absent or in the opposite direction to the generally accepted view at the start of training, and are present only for response time (RT) at the end of training. The widely accepted strategy of retrieval from an integrated mental representation does emerge; but only after an initial associative process and a deductive process. Regarding three comparisons critical for demonstrating deductive TI, the inference was more demanding than its antecedents both in terms of accuracy and RT, and both after initial and final training. Existing theories of TI account for some of these findings, but what is required is a theory accommodating them all.},

@article{ameel2007,
	Abstract = {The present paper focuses on the heuristic selection process preceding the actual transitive reasoning process. A part of the difficulty of transitive reasoning lies in the selection of the relevant problem aspects. Two experiments are presented using the paradigm introduced by Markovits, Dumas, and Malfait (1995), in which children were asked to make ``higher than'' inferences about arrays of coloured blocks. In order to discriminate between genuine transitive inference and a simple strategy of relative position, Markovits et al. interspersed white blocks with the coloured blocks, such that the relative position strategy leads to erroneous responses. However, we argue that the white blocks cause confusion due to their ambiguity, which interferes with the heuristic selection process. Two methodological adaptations were introduced, which are hypothesised to facilitate the selection process and improve transitive reasoning: (1) the white blocks were replaced by coloured blocks, and (2) a less abstract context was added to the experimental design. The colour manipulation leads to a clear increase in the use of a transitive strategy by 9-year-old children; 8-year-old children mainly used the relative position strategy. When adding a context story, 9-year-old children used the transitive strategy regardless of the colour of the interspersed blocks. The overall performance of 8-year-olds improved slightly. These results are interpreted as support for a dual-process model of transitive reasoning.},

In nonconflict problems, weights or distances varied, while the other was held constant. In conflict items, both weight and distance varied, and items were of three kinds: weight dominant, distance dominant, or balance (in which neither was dominant). In Experiment 1, 2-year-old children succeeded on nonconflict-weight and nonconflict-distance problems. This result was replicated in Experiment 2, but performance on conflict items did not exceed chance. In Experiment 3, 3- and 4-year-olds succeeded on all except conflict balance problems, while 5- and 6-year-olds succeeded on all problem types. The results were interpreted in terms of relational complexity theory. Children aged 2 to 4 years succeeded on problems that entailed binary relations, but 5- and 6-year-olds also succeeded on problems that entailed ternary relations.

	Abstract = {Transitive-inference tasks play increasing roles in many areas of cognitive science. However, discrepancies between the two competing paradigms (classical-Piagetian and IP-paradigm) imply that one paradigm fails to index its target (deductive) competence. Here, potential flaws of one were addressed using considerations from the other. Children of 5\textendash{}7 years (N=216) solved 3-term transitive problems, some implying a single largest item, and some not. Findings indicate a discriminative competence (a Transitive-Switch) at least 2 years before competence in actually deducing correct solutions. Interestingly, although the transitive-switch was constant across age with both memory and inference increasing with age, it was nevertheless a much stronger predictor of transitive performance than either memory or age. A predictive relationship between memory and inference held for the 5- and 6-year-olds but not the 7-year-olds; suggesting as it approaches maturity, transitive-inference becomes independent of memory. Coincidental with this latter finding, only the 7-year-olds' transitive performance approximated a deductive competence. As the initial validation of the IP-paradigm rested on acceptance of its age estimate of 4 years, its claim to index deduction must now be revisited.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference is claimed to be ``deductive''. Yet every group/species ever reported apparently uses it. We asked 58 adults to solve five-term transitive tasks, requiring neither training nor premise learning. A computer-based procedure ensured all premises were continually visible. Response accuracy and RT (non-discriminative nRT) were measured as is typically done. We also measured RT confined to correct responses (cRT). Overall, very few typical transitive phenomena emerged. The symbolic distance effect never extended to premise recall and was not at all evident for nRT; suggesting the use of non-deductive end-anchor strategies. For overall performance, and particularly the critical B?D inference, our findings indicate that deductive transitive inference is far more intellectually challenging than previously thought. Contrasts of our present findings against previous findings suggest at least two distinct transitive inference modes, with most research and most computational models to date targeting an associative mode rather than their desired deductive mode. This conclusion fits well with the growing number of theories embracing a ``dual process'' conception of reasoning. Finally, our differing findings for nRT versus cRT suggest that researchers should give closer consideration to matching the RT measure they use to the particular conception of transitive inference they pre-held.},

@article{wright2011,
	Abstract = {Transitive inference underpins many human reasoning competencies. The dominant task (the ``extensive training paradigm'') employs many items and large amounts of training, instilling an ordered series in the reasoner's mind. But findings from an alternative ``three-term paradigm'' suggest transitivity is not present until 7 + years. Interestingly, a second alternative paradigm (the ``spatial task''), using simultaneously displayed height relationships to form premise pairs, can uphold the 4-year estimate. However, this paradigm risks cueing children and hence is problematic. We investigated whether a height-task variant might correspond to a more ecologically valid three-term task. A total of 222 4\textendash{}6-year-olds either completed a modified height task, including an increased familiarisation phase, or a computer-animated task about cartoon characters running a race in pairs. Findings confirmed that both tasks were functionally identical. Crucially, 4-year-olds were at chance on both, whereas 6-year-olds performed competently. These findings contrast with estimates from all three paradigms considered. A theoretical evaluation of our tasks and procedures against previous ones, leads us to two conclusions. First, our estimate slightly amends the 7-year estimate offered by the three-term paradigm, with the difference explained in terms of its greater relevance to child experiences. Second, our estimate can coexist alongside the 4-year estimate from the extensive training paradigm. This is because, applying a recently developed ``dual-process'' conception of reasoning, anticipates that extensive training benefits a species-general associative system, while the spatial paradigm and three-term paradigm can potentially index a genuinely deductive system, which has always been the target of transitive research.},

We asked 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds (N = 117) to solve a composite of five different transitive tasks. Tasks included conditions asking about item-C (associated with the marked relation) in addition to the usual case of asking only about item-A (associated with the unmarked relation). Here, children found resolving item-C much easier than resolving item-A, a finding running counter to long-standing assumptions about transitive reasoning. Considering gender perhaps for the first time, boys exhibited higher transitive scores than girls overall. Finally, analysing in the context of one recent and well-specified theory of spatial transitive reasoning, we generated the prediction that reporting the full series should be easier than deducing any one item from that series. This prediction was not upheld. We discuss amendments necessary to accommodate all our earlier findings.},

This led to controversies about the influence of t,\textasciitilde{}k characteristics on individuals' performance and the development of transitive reasoning. In this study, a computer test was constructed containing 16 transitive reasoning tasks having different characteristics with respect to presentation form, task format, and task content. Both product and strategy information were analyzed to measure the performance of 6- to 13-year-old children. Three methods (MSP, DE'fECal, and Improved DIMTEST) were used to determine the number of abilities involved and to test the assumptions imposed on the data by item response models. Nonparametric IRT models were used to construct a scale for transitive reasoning. Multiple regression was used to determine the influence of task characteristics on the difficulty level of the tasks. It was concluded that: (1) the qualitatively distinct abilities predicted by Piaget's theory could not be distinguished by means of different dimensions in the data structure; (2) transitive reasoning could be described by one ability, and some task characteristics influenced the difficulty of a task; and (3) strategy information provided a stronger scale than product information.},

	Abstract = {Fersen et al. (J99 1) (1. Exp. Psychol. : Anim. Behav. Process., 17: 334-34 1) trained pigeons to discriminate -"our overlapping pairs of stimuli A+ B- , B+ C-, C+ D- and D+ E- (+ rewarded, - penalized). When subsequently tested with a pair BD the pigeons showed a strong preference for stimulus B. A special value transfer theory was offered as an explanation for this transitive responding. A simpler reinforcement ratio account based on certain inequalities fac tu all y affecting the accuracy performance on training pairs is proposed. To explore its implications an experiment employing a novel grit-grain conditioning method was carried out. The presentation frequencies of the training pairs were biased so that the choice accuracies obtained at the end of training were approximately equal for all pairs. Testing with pair BD still yielded high preference for B, documenting the robustness of the transitive responding phenomenon. When suitably adjusted to the training design the reinforcement ratio account was still viable. The transitive responding with the BD and other test pairs could also be simulated with a simple reinforcement based condi tioning model. Some of the subjects were then retrained with modified presentation frequencies so that the subjects ended up with an even overall exposure to all training pairs. Test pairs continued to yield strong transitive responding. It is concluded that this behavioral effect is a robust phenomenon which is largely unaffected by training design modifications.},

@article{bryson2007,
	Abstract = {Transitive performance (TP) is a learning-based behaviour exhibited by a wide range of species, where if a subject has been taught to prefer A when presented with the pair AB but to prefer B when presented with the pair BC, then the subject will also prefer A when presented with the novel pair AC. Most explanations of TP assume that subjects recognize and learn an underlying sequence from observing the training pairs. However, data from squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and young children contradict this, showing that when three different items (a triad) are drawn from the sequence, subjects' performance degrades systematically (McGonigle and Chalmers, Nature 267:694\textendash{}696, 1977; Chalmers and McGonigle, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 37:355\textendash{}377, 1984; Harris and McGonigle, The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 47B:319\textendash{}348, 1994). We present here the two-tier model, the first learning model of TP which accounts for this systematic performance degradation. Our model assumes primate TP is based on a general-purpose task learning system rather than a special-purpose sequence-learning system. It supports the hypothesis of Heckers et al. (Hippocampus 14:153\textendash{}162, 2004) that TP is an expression of two separate general learning elements: one for associating actions and contexts, another for prioritising associations when more than one context is present. The two-tier model also provides explanations for why phased training is important for helping subjects learn the initial training pairs and why some subjects fail to do so. It also supports the Harris and McGonigle (The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 47B:319\textendash{}348, 1994) explanation of why, once the training pairs have been acquired, subjects perform transitive choice automatically on two-item diads, but not when exposed to triads from the same sequence.},

	Abstract = {This paper is a review of current knowledge and a guide to the literature on the development of spatial cognition. We are interested in how people develop a knowledge of space. First, how do the fundamental concepts of space develop in the child? And, second, how do we come to know and represent in cognition the everyday physical environment? The review is in three sections. First, an attempt is made to provide some definitions and conceptual distinctions as a base for the field. The second section covers development of the fundamental concepts of space, starting with the epistemological problem of space and the resolutions of Descartes, Berkeley, Kant, and Cassirer. Out of this tradition come Werner's and Piaget's empirically based theories of the development of the child's conception of space. The third section focuses on empirical research on the development of cognition of the larger physical environment. Following a discussion of the ontogenetic development of both geographic orientation and topographical representations and the systems of reference they utilize, we lead into the scant literature which deals with the microgenetic development of representations of new or unfamiliar environments. Parallels and discontinuities with the theories of Piaget and Werner are discussed throughout as a means both of providing coherence to otherwise unrelated studies and of suggesting avenues of theoretical explanation.

@book{perner1991,
	Abstract = {"Understanding the Representational Mind" synthesizes the growing literature on the child's theory of mind to provide an integrated account of children's understanding of representational and mental processes, which is crucial in their acquisition of commonsense psychology.  Perner describes experimental work on children's acquisition of a theory of mind and representation, offers a theoretical account of this acquisition, and gives examples of how the increased sophistication in children's theory of mind improves their understanding of social interaction and how, in the case of autistic children, an impairment results in social ineptitude. He analyzes the concepts of representation and metarepresentation as they appear in current discussion in the philosophy of cognitive science and explains how the unfolding of mental representation enables infants to comprehend change over time, engage in pretence, and use representational systems like pictures and language. Perner goes on to show that around age four children become able to understand the representational nature of pictures and language and to distinguish appearance from reality.  Introducing basic distinctions in philosophy of mind for characterizing the mental, Perner discusses differences in how commonsense and cognitive psychology view the mind. Tracing the onset of a commonsense psychology in the social and emotional awareness of early infancy, he reveals how the child begins to take a cognitive, representational view of the mind with repercussions for children's episodic memory, self-control, and their ability to engage in deception. Perner concludes by describing the observed developmental changes as a case of theory change and contrasts his thesis with competing proposals.

@article{gazes2014,
	Abstract = {It is often suggested that transitive inference (TI; if A{$>$}B and B{$>$}C then A{$>$}C) involves mentally representing overlapping pairs of stimuli in a spatial series. However, there is little direct evidence to unequivocally determine the role of spatial representation in TI. We tested whether humans and rhesus monkeys use spatial representations in TI by training them to organize seven images in a vertical spatial array. Then, we presented subjects with a TI task using these same images. The implied TI order was either congruent or incongruent with the order of the trained spatial array. Humans in the congruent condition learned premise pairs more quickly, and were faster and more accurate in critical probe tests, suggesting that the spatial arrangement of images learned during spatial training influenced subsequent TI performance. Monkeys first trained in the congruent condition also showed higher test trial accuracy when the spatial and inferred orders were congruent. These results directly support the hypothesis that humans solve TI problems by spatial organization, and suggest that this cognitive mechanism for inference may have ancient evolutionary roots.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT. The production of sequences by two mentally retarded adults and a normally capable preschooler was assessed after each was trained to touch five physically dissimilar and nonrepresentative forms in an experimenter-specified order (denoted A1\textrightarrowA2\textrightarrowA3\textrightarrowA4\textrightarrowA5). Performance on the 10 constituent two-term sequences was examined (e.g, A\textrightarrowA2, A2\textrightarrowA3, Al\textrightarrowA3 and A2\textrightarrowA4). The probe data were largely consistent with the five-term sequence performance trained explicitly and suggest the formation of stimulus relations based on relative position rather than a rote stimulus-response chain. The procedures and results were replicated with a second five-term sequence (B1\textrightarrowB2\textrightarrowB3\textrightarrowB4\textrightarrowB5). The subjects\texttimes{} performances were also assessed on trials in which mixtures of the two sets of stimuli were presented as either two-term probes (e.g. A2\textrightarrowB4 and B2\textrightarrowA4; with all three subjects) or five-term probes (e.g. Al\textrightarrowB2\textrightarrowA3\textrightarrowB4\textrightarrowA5; with the two adult subjects). Again, the subjects' performances were consistent with their baseline training. The mixed-probe data extend prior research on sequence production and suggest the formation of classes of mutually substitutable sequence stimuli. The overall findings highlight the importance of experiential variables in the formation of ordinal relations in developmentally limited individuals.},

	Abstract = {A critical aspect of inferential reasoning is the ability to form a relationship between items or events that were not experienced together. This review will consider different perspectives on the role of the hippocampus in successful inferential reasoning. Traditional research on inferential reasoning has focused on retrieval-based processes that mediate performance. To make inferences about indirect relationships between discrete events, elements of individual memories must be individually retrieved and recombined. Specialized encoding mechanisms are needed to enable this flexible retrieval. The hippocampus has been shown to discretely code events in such a way that event elements are individually accessible from memory. For this reason, recent research has also focused on hippocampal encoding processes that support inferential reasoning, including an integrative mechanism that combines information across multiple experiences. By recalling past events during the encoding of new experiences, connections can be created between newly formed and existing memories. Such derived memories extend beyond direct experience to anticipate future judgments about the relationship between items and events. Successful inference, according to this view, would result from the expression of relational knowledge acquired through hippocampally-mediated integrative encoding. We discuss this latter perspective in the context of emerging evidence linking the hippocampus to the formation of schemas as well as prospective theories of hippocampal function that suggest memories are actively constructed to anticipate future decisions and actions.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) has been studied in humans and several animals such as rats, pigeons and fishes. Using different methods for training premises it has been shown that a non-trained relation between stimuli can be stablished, so that if A {$>$} B {$>$} C {$>$} D {$>$} E, then B {$>$} D. Despite the widely reported cases of transitive inference, the specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain under discussion. In the present experiment pigeons were trained in a transitive inference procedure with four premises. After being exposed to all premises, the pigeons showed a consistent preference for B over D during the test. After overtraining C+D- alone, B was still preferred over D. However, the expected pattern of training performance (referred to as serial position effect) was distorted, whereas TI remained unaltered. The results are discussed regarding value transfer and reinforcement contingencies as possible mechanisms. We conclude that reinforcement contingencies can affect training performance without altering TI.},

	Abstract = {The observation that monkeys make transitive inferences has been taken as evidence of their ability to form and manipulate mental representations. However, alternative explanations have been proposed arguing that transitive inference performance is based on expected or experienced reward value. We performed two experiments, in which we manipulated the amount of reward associated with each item in an ordered list, to test the contribution of reward value to monkeys' behavior in TI paradigms. Monkeys were presented with pairs of list items and were rewarded if they selected the item with the earlier list rank. When reward magnitude was biased to favor later list items, correct responding was reduced. However, monkeys eventually learned to make correct rule-based choices despite opposing incentives. The results demonstrate that monkeys' performance in TI paradigms is not driven solely by expected reward and that they are able to make appropriate inferences when given discordant rewards.},

TI has been found in a wide range of vertebrates but not in insects. Here, we test whether Polistes dominula and Polistes metricus paper wasps can solve a TI problem. Wasps were trained to discriminate between five elements in series (A0B-, B0C-, C0D-, D0E-), then tested on novel, untrained pairs (B versus D). Consistent with TI, wasps chose B more frequently than D. Wasps organized the trained stimuli into an implicit hierarchy and used TI to choose between untrained pairs. Species that form social hierarchies like Polistes may be predisposed to spontaneously organize information along a common underlying dimension. This work contributes to a growing body of evidence that the miniature nervous system of insects does not limit sophisticated behaviours.},

@article{jensen2017,
	Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) is a classic learning paradigm for which the relative contributions of experienced rewards and representation-driven inference have been vigorously debated, particularly with regard to the notion that animals are capable of logic and reasoning. Rhesus macaque subjects and human participants performed a TI task in which, prior to learning a seven-item list ABCDEFG, a block of trials presented exclusively the pair FG. Contrary to the expectation of associative models, the high prior rate of reward for F did not disrupt learning of the entire list. Monkeys (who each completed many sessions) learned to anticipate that novel stimuli should be preferred over F. We interpret this as evidence of a task representation of TI that generalizes beyond learning about specific stimuli. Humans (who were task-na{\"\i}ve) showed a transitory bias to F when it was paired with novel stimuli, but very rapidly unlearned that bias. Performance with respect to the remaining stimuli was consistent with past reports of TI in both species. These results are difficult to reconcile with any account that seeks to assign the strength of association between individual stimuli and rewards. Instead, they support both sophisticated cognitive processes in both species, albeit with some species differences.},

One of the chimpanzees begins to climb a tree; others do the same. As the first chimpanzee is nearing the top, two monkeys quickly run along a thin branch away from him towards the edge of the tree. The chimpanzee does not follow them but climbs down slightly and begins to travel in the same direction as the monkeys on a much ticker branch right below them. As the chimpanzee is about to reach the monkeys' position, they suddenly leap into the air landing on a neighboring tree. The chasing chimpanzee cannot follow them but the monkeys have made a fatal mistake. They are now surrounded by the rest of the troop and after a short pursuit one of them is captured and brought down to the ground. Even though the male who caught the monkey shares his bounty with other chimpanzees, the chimpanzee who initiated the chase climbs up again heading for the canopy where it catches the second monkey although it had remained motionless and hidden since its companion's capture},

How the brain controls these logical processes remains an unanswered question that has been merely superficially ad-dressed in neuroimaging and lesion studies, which are unable to identify the underlying neuronal computations. We observed that theactivation pattern of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during pair comparisons in a highly demanding transitive inference task fullysupports the behavioral performance of the two monkeys that we tested.

In neither experiment were there children who justified an incorrect inference by incorrect premises or a solo premise. The results are interpreted as showing that not only can incorrect inferers store the correct premises, but that they can also retrieve them adequately.

	Abstract = {An analysis is presented of the relational information needed for premise integration in transitivity and simple serial order tasks. The tasks are divided into those where an ordering decision can be made by considering a single binary relation, and those where two binary relations must be considered. Four experiments are reported, the principal purpose of which is to manipulate the number of relations which must be considered in making decisions about the order of a small set of elements. In every test it was found that preschool children succeeded if decisions could be made by considering one relation, but failed if two relations had to be considered. Children over 5 almost always succeeded in both cases. It is concluded that preschool children cannot integrate relational premise information, and therefore cannot understand transitivity or serial order. This would impose limitations on their understanding of quantification and a number of other concepts. It is also suggested that the amount of information required to make a single decision may be an important factor determining cognitive complexity generally.},

In this article we present the results of a study that examined the correlates of this ability in a group of 10-year-old children (N=61). Participants were presented with conditional and relational reasoning items, where the content was manipulated such that the conclusion to the arguments were either congruent, neutral, or incongruent with beliefs, and either logically valid or logically invalid. Participants also received a measure of working memory capacity (the counting span task) and a measure of inhibitory control (the stop signal task). Indices of belief bias and logical reasoning on belief-based problems were predicted independently by both measures. In contrast logical reasoning on belief neutral problems was predicted by working memory alone. The findings suggest that executive functions play a key role in the development of children's ability to decontextualise their thinking.},

	Abstract = {Living in large, stable groups is often considered to favour the evolution of cognitive abilities related to social living, such as the ability to track relationships among group members and to make transitive inferences about relationships based on indirect evidence. Greylag geese are relatively small brained, but live in complex societies with social support and clan structures. They form dominance hierarchies in which families dominate pairs and unpaired individuals. However, competition is costly and the ability to transitively infer relationships among flock members may be highly advantageous. We tested five free-living, juvenile greylag geese embedded in a flock of 150 birds for their ability to track multiple dyadic relationships and their transitive inference competence. Individuals were trained on discriminations between successive pairs of five implicitly ordered colours (A\textendash{}E). All individuals learned to track four dyadic relationships simultaneously and showed transitive inference when presented with nonadjacent colours. Remarkably, the amount of training required was related to the individual's early social environment. Our study is one of the first to show transitive inference in a precocial bird and suggests an influence of early social experience on sociocognitive abilities. Furthermore, it improves our understanding of social complexity as an important selection pressure for the evolution of cognition.},

	Abstract = {Category learning in animals is typically trained explicitly, in most instances by varying the exemplars of a single category in a matching-to-sample task. Here, we show that male rhesus macaques can learn categories by a transitive inference paradigm in which novel exemplars of five categories were presented throughout training. Instead of requiring decisions about a constant set of repetitively presented stimuli, we studied the macaque's ability to determine the relative order of multiple exemplars of particular stimuli that were rarely repeated. Ordinal decisions generalized both to novel stimuli and, as a consequence, to novel pairings. Thus, we showed that rhesus monkeys could learn to categorize on the basis of implied ordinal position, without prior matching-to-sample training, and that they could then make inferences about category order. Our results challenge the plausibility of association models of category learning and broaden the scope of the transitive inference paradigm.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The cognitive abilities of nonhuman animals are of enduring interest to scientists and the general public because they blur the dividing line between human and nonhuman intelligence. Categorization and sequence learning are highly abstract cognitive abilities each in their own right. This study is the first to provide evidence that visual categories can be ordered serially by macaque monkeys using a behavioral paradigm that provides no explicit feedback about category or serial order. These results strongly challenge accounts of learning based on stimulus\textendash{}response associations.},

	Abstract = {A core assumption of many theories of development is that children can learn indirectly from other people. However, indirect experience (or testimony) is not constrained to provide veridical information. As a result, if children are to capitalize on this source of knowledge, they must be able to infer who is trustworthy and who is not. How might a learner make such inferences while at the same time learning about the world? What biases, if any, might children bring to this problem? We address these questions with a computational model of epistemic trust in which learners reason about the helpfulness and knowledgeability of an informant. We show that the model captures the competencies shown by young children in four areas: (1) using informants' accuracy to infer how much to trust them; (2) using informants' recent accuracy to overcome effects of familiarity; (3) inferring trust based on consensus among informants; and (4) using information about mal-intent to decide not to trust. The model also explains developmental changes in performance between 3 and 4 years of age as a result of changing default assumptions about the helpfulness of other people.},

	Abstract = {The capacity to reason about complex information is a central characteristic of human cognition. An important component of many reasoning tasks is the need to integrate multiple mental relations. Several researchers have argued that rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) plays a key role in relational integration. If this hypothesis is correct, then RLPFC should play a key role in transitive inference, which requires the integration of multiple relations to reach a conclusion. Thus far, however, neuroscientific research on transitive inference has focused primarily on the hippocampus. In this fMRI study, we sought to compare the roles of RLPFC and the hippocampus on a novel transitive inference paradigm. Four relations between colored balls were presented on the screen together with a target relation. Participants were asked to decide whether the target relation was correct, given the other indicated relations between balls. RLPFC, but not the hippocampus, exhibited stronger activation on trials that required relational integration as compared with trials that involved relational encoding without integration. In contrast, the hippocampus exhibited a pattern consistent with a role in relational encoding, with stronger activation on trials requiring encoding of relational predicate\textendash{}argument structure as compared with trials requiring encoding of item\textendash{}item associations. Functional connectivity analyses give rise to the hypothesis that RLPFC draws on hippocampal representations of mental relations during the process of relational integration.},

Rather than involving languagebased statements of premises, a network of simple discriminations provides the prerequisites for the emergence of new discriminations involving the transitive relations among stimuli.

	Abstract = {Summary
Primates are remarkably adept at ranking each other within social hierarchies, a capacity that is critical to successful group living. Surprisingly little, however, is understood about the neurobiology underlying this quintessential aspect of primate cognition. In our experiment, participants first acquired knowledge about a social and a nonsocial hierarchy and then used this information to guide investment decisions. We found that neural activity in the amygdala tracked the development of knowledge about~a social, but not a nonsocial, hierarchy. Further, structural variations in amygdala gray matter volume accounted for interindividual differences in social transitivity performance. Finally, the amygdala expressed a neural signal selectively coding for social rank, whose robustness predicted the influence of rank on participants' investment decisions. In contrast, we observed that the linear structure of both social and nonsocial hierarchies was represented at a neural level in the hippocampus. Our study implicates the amygdala in the emergence and representation of knowledge about social hierarchies and distinguishes the domain-general contribution of the hippocampus.},

Knowledge about social hierarchies organizes human behavior, yet we understand little about the underlying computations. Here we show that a Bayesian inference scheme, which tracks the power of individuals, better captures behavioral and neural data compared with a reinforcement learning model inspired by rating systems used in games such as~chess. We provide evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) selectively mediates the updating of knowledge about one's own hierarchy, as opposed to that of another individual, a process~that underpinned successful performance and~involved functional interactions with the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast, we observed domain-general coding of rank in the amygdala and hippocampus, even when the task did not require it. Our findings reveal the computations underlying a core aspect of social cognition and provide new evidence that self-relevant information may indeed be afforded a unique representational status in the brain.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Humans and other primates have evolved the ability to represent their status in the group's social hierarchy, which is essential for avoiding harm and accessing resources. Yet it remains unclear how the human brain learns dominance status and adjusts behavior accordingly during dynamic social interactions. Here we address this issue with a combination of fMRI and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In a first fMRI experiment, participants learned an implicit dominance hierarchy while playing a competitive game against three opponents of different skills. Neural activity in the rostromedial PFC (rmPFC) dynamically tracked and updated the dominance status of the opponents, whereas the ventromedial PFC and ventral striatum reacted specifically to competitive victories and defeats. In a second experiment, we applied anodal tDCS over the rmPFC to enhance neural excitability while subjects performed a similar competitive task. The stimulation enhanced the relative weight of victories over defeats in learning social dominance relationships and exacerbated the influence of one's own dominance over competitive strategies. Importantly, these tDCS effects were specific to trials in which subjects learned about dominance relationships, as they were not present for control choices associated with monetary incentives but no competitive feedback. Taken together, our findings elucidate the role of rmPFC computations in dominance learning and unravel a fundamental mechanism that governs the emergence and maintenance of social dominance relationships in humans.},

@article{williams2012,
	Abstract = {Background
Previous studies indicate the transition to psychosis is associated with dynamic changes of hippocampal integrity. Here we explored hippocampal volume and neural activation during a relational memory task in patients who were in the early stage of a psychotic illness.

Methods
41 early psychosis patients and 34 healthy controls completed a transitive inference (TI) task used previously in chronic schizophrenia patients. Participants learned to select the ``winner'' of two sets of stimulus pairs drawn from an overlapping sequence (A{$>$}B{$>$}C{$>$}D{$>$}E) and a non-overlapping set (a{$>$}b, c{$>$}d, e{$>$}f, g{$>$}h). During an fMRI scan, participants were tested on the trained pairs and made inferential judgments on novel pairings that could be solved based on training (e.g. B vs. D). Hippocampal volumes were manually segmented and compared between groups. fMRI analyses included 27 early psychosis patients and 30 controls who met memory training criteria.

Results
Groups did not differ on inference performance or hippocampal volume, and exhibited similar activation of medial temporal regions when judging non-overlapping pairs. However, patients who failed to meet memory training criteria had smaller hippocampal volumes. Neural activity during TI was less widespread in early psychosis patients but between-group differences were not significant. Hippocampal activity during TI was positively correlated with inference performance only in control subjects.

Conclusions
Our results provide evidence that relational memory impairment and hippocampal abnormalities, well established in chronic schizophrenia, are not fully present in early psychosis patients. This provides a rationale for early intervention, targeting the possible delay, reduction, or prevention of these deficits.},

Five macaque monkeys were trained via two-choice object discriminations in a formboard apparatus on several five-item-series tasks that provided different levels of intrasession conditionality. Although ease of acquisition differed for subsets of the constituent pairs, concurrent inclusion of the four premise pairs that defined a list required equivalent amounts of training on every task. All training procedures yielded similar retention-test performances and showed common organizational properties (on both error and latency measures) consistent with the view that lists were retained as internally represented ordered series. Test outcomes emphasized the need for integrated exposition of all concurrent conditional relationships to allow appropriate tests of serial organization. However, if given such training, the monkeys revealed integrated serial memory even though they had never seen many of the possible novel combinations of list items. In overview, their performances offered further definition of the procedures required for valid assessment of inferential properties in comparative cognition.},

	Abstract = {In nonhuman animals, the transitive inference (TI) task typically involves training a series of four simultaneous discriminations involving, for example, arbitrary colors in which choice of one stimulus in each pair is reinforced [{\th}] and choice of the other color is nonreinforced [-]. This can be represented as A {\th} B-, B {\th} C-, C {\th} D-, D {\th} E- and can be conceptualized as a series of linear relationships: A {$>$} B {$>$} C {$>$} D {$>$} E. After training, animals are tested on the untrained non-endpoint pair, BD. Preference for B over D is taken as evidence of TI and occurs because B is greater than D in the implied series. In the present study we trained pigeons using a novel training procedure\textemdash{}a hybrid of successive pair training (training one pair at a time) and mixed-pair training (training all pairs at once)\textemdash{}designed to overcome some of the limitations of earlier procedures. Using this hybrid procedure, we trained five premise pairs (A {\th} B-, B {\th} C-, C {\th} D-, D {\th} E-, and E {\th} F-) which allowed us to test three untrained non-endpoint pairs (BD, CE, and BE). A significant TI effect was found for most subjects on at least two out of three test pairs. Different theories of TI are discussed. The results suggest that this hybrid training is an efficient procedure for establishing mixedpair acquisition and a TI effect.},

@article{lazareva2004,
	Abstract = {Eight crows were taught to discriminate overlapping pairs of visual stimuli (Aϩ BϪ, Bϩ CϪ, Cϩ DϪ, and Dϩ EϪ). For 4 birds, the stimuli were colored cards with a circle of the same color on the reverse side whose diameter decreased from A to E (ordered feedback group). These circles were made available for comparison to potentially help the crows order the stimuli along a physical dimension. For the other 4 birds, the circles corresponding to the colored cards had the same diameter (constant feedback group). In later testing, a novel choice pair (BD) was presented. Reinforcement history involving stimuli B and D was controlled so that the reinforcement/nonreinforcement ratios for the latter would be greater than for the former. If, during the BD test, the crows chose between stimuli according to these reinforcement/nonreinforcement ratios, then they should prefer D; if they chose according to the diameter of the feedback stimuli, then they should prefer B. In the ordered feedback group, the crows strongly preferred B over D; in the constant feedback group, the crows' choice did not differ significantly from chance. These results, plus simulations using associative models, suggest that the orderability of the postchoice feedback stimuli is important for crows' transitive responding.},

	Abstract = {Ingenious and seemingly powerful technologies have been developed recently that enable the visualization in some detail of events in the brain concomitant upon the ongoing behavioral performance of a human participant. Measurement of such brain events offers at the very least a new set of dependent variables in relation to which the independent variables familiarly manipulated in the operant laboratory may be explored. Two related paradigms in which a start has been made in such research concern the derivation of novel or emergent relations from a baseline set of trained relations, and include the phenomenon of transitive inference (TI), observed in studies of stimulus equivalence (SE) and serial learning (SL) or seriation. This paper reviews some published and forthcoming neuroimaging studies of these and related phenomena, and considers how this line of research both demands and represents a welcome synthesis between types of question and levels of explanation in behavioral science that often have been seen as antithetical.},

@phdthesis{robson,
	Abstract = {Transitive inference refers to the ability to use knowledge of pre-existing relationships to
infer relationships between entities that have not been directly compared. This form of logical
inference is an important skill for many social species, and has been thought to arise in an
immature form in humans between the ages of four and six years. The experimental methods
used to test this ability in humans often require some verbal skill, gross or fine motor
coordination, a memory capable of containing numerous relationships, and often a great deal of
time and repetition in testing. These methods of testing may have been too demanding on other
physical and cognitive abilities to be successfully completed by children under four years of age,
regardless of their ability to make transitive inferences.
The present study used methods sensitive to infant cognition to test the current theory that
the ability to make transitive inferences does not develop until the age of four. Nine-month-old
infants were tested in three separate experiments using a visual habituation paradigm similar to
that used by Woodward (1998) and through investigation of infants' own imitative actions.
Experiment 1 verified that infants can track the goals of others in a habituation paradigm when
the goal object changes position throughout habituation trials, both through looking time
measures and imitative action. Experiment 2 used an extension of this paradigm to examine the
ability to make transitive inferences across a three item chain, serially ordered by the actor's
object preference, and no evidence of transitive inference was observed. Experiment 3 tested
infants' ability to habituate to and recall multiple goals using context as a cue to actor choice.
Infants were able to consistently track only one of the pairings, suggesting that avoidance, in
addition to selection, may play a role in infant performance in the visual habituation paradigm.},

@article{wendelken2015,
	Abstract = {Reasoning depends on the contribution of posterior parietal cortex (PPC). But PPC is involved in many basic operations -- including spatial attention, mathematical cognition, working memory, long-term memory, and language -- and the nature of its contribution to reasoning is unclear. Psychological theories of the processes underlying reasoning make divergent claims about the neural systems that are likely to be involved, and better understanding the specific contribution of PPC can help to inform these theories. We set out to address several competing hypotheses, concerning the role of PPC in reasoning: 1) reasoning involves application of formal logic and is dependent on language, with PPC activation for reasoning mainly reflective of linguistic processing, 2) reasoning involves probabilistic computation and is thus dependent on numerical processing mechanisms in PPC, and 3) reasoning is built upon the representation and processing of spatial relations, and PPC activation associated with reasoning reflects spatial processing. We conducted two separate meta-analyses. First, we pooled data from our own studies of reasoning in adults, and examined activation in PPC regions of interest. Second, we conducted an automated meta-analysis using Neurosynth, in which we examined overlap between activation maps associated with reasoning and maps associated with other key functions of PPC. In both analyses, we observed reasoning-related activation concentrated in the left Inferior Parietal Lobe (IPL). Reasoning maps demonstrated the greatest overlap with mathematical cognition. Maintenance, visuospatial, and phonological processing also demonstrated some overlap with reasoning, but a large portion of the reasoning map did not overlap with the map for any other function. This evidence suggests that the PPC's contribution to reasoning may be most closely related to its role in mathematical cognition, but that a core component of this contribution may be specific to reasoning.},

	Abstract = {The present study examined the effectiveness of the Relational Completion Procedure (RCP) in establishing arbitrarily applicable comparative relations after training with either linear (Experiment 1) or non- linear (Experiment 2) arbitrary relations. Linear relations were those presented in a sequential order (i.e., A-B, B-C, C-D, etc.), while nonlinear relations were presented in a nonsequential order (i.e., C-D, B-C, A-B, etc.). After nonarbitrary relational training and testing to establish the contextual functions of MORE THAN and LESS THAN, adults underwent constructed- response nonarbitrary relational training and testing with physically dissimilar stimuli in which they were required to "complete" relational sentences in the presence of the cues. Next, during arbitrary relational training with abstract stimuli, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 training groups: All- More (E {$>$} D, D {$>$} C, C {$>$} B, and B {$>$} A), All- Less (A {$<$} B, B {$<$} C, C {$<$} D, and D {$<$} E), and Less- More (A {$<$} B, B {$<$} C, D {$>$} C, and E {$>$} D). Finally, during arbitrary relational testing, probes for mutually entailed relations were followed by probes for 1- and 2- node combinatorially entailed relations. The yield, or percentage of participants passing, was 83\% in Experiment 1 and 91.6\% in Experiment 2. Our findings demonstrate that the RCP was successful in establishing arbitrarily applicable comparative relations with adults regardless of the order in which the arbitrary relational training trials were presented.},

Seven proceeded rapidly through training and passed tests with a novel set. They then participated in Study 2. Four typically developing children and 2 with autism failed baseline B-D tests.

	Abstract = {Reasoning requires making inferences based on information gleaned from a set of relations. The relational complexity of a problem increases with the number of relations that must be considered simultaneously to make a correct inference. Previous work (Viskontas, Morrison, Holyoak, Hummel, \& Knowlton, 2004) has shown that older adults have difficulty integrating multiple relations during analogical reasoning, especially when required to inhibit irrelevant information. We report two experiments that examined the ability to integrate multiple relations in younger, middle-aged, and older adults performing two other reasoning tasks. These tasks systematically varied relational complexity, and required either inductive reasoning (a version of the Raven's Matrices Task) or transitive inference. Our results show that as people age they have increasing difficulty in solving problems that require them to integrate multiple relations. This difficulty may stem from a decrease in working memory capacity.},

	Abstract = {At the turn of last century, psychology, including developmental psychology, was introduced into China. Since then, developmental psychology has always been one of the main branches of Chinese psychology. This paper reviews the progress of Chinese developmental psychology in the last century, with special emphasis on its development during the recent 20 years. The paper consists of three sections. The first is a historical review. The 100 years' history of Chinese developmental psychology has been divided into three phases: first half of the 20th century; the period between 1950s and 1970s after the foundation of the People's Republic of China; and the period from the end of the 1970s up to the present. The authors briefly describe the initiation of Chinese developmental psychology, highlighting the research and related work in the field during the three phases. The second section of the paper introduces the research conducted by Chinese developmental psychologists during the last two decades in the following areas: cognitive development, language development, social development and socialization, the study of gifted children, cross-cultural studies of child development, the study of only children, and the psychology of ageing. This section is the focus of the paper, because in this period, developmental psychology in China has progressed steadily on a sustained course and entered an unprecedented thriving period along with the State opening-up policy and structural reformation. The last section is an appraisal of the past and prospects for the future. Here, the authors comment on the characteristics and achievements of Chinese developmental psychology in the 20th century and discuss future directions for its further development in terms of research scope and depth, research methods, indigenization, and application.},

	Abstract = {We review the literature on the development of transitive reasoning, and note three historical stages. Stage 1 was dominated by the Piagetian idea that transitive inference is logical reasoning in which relationships between adjacent terms figure as premises. Stage 2 was dominated by the information-processing view that memory for relationships between adjacent terms is determinative in transitivity performance. Stage 3 has produced data that are inconsistent with both the logic and memory positions, leading to a new theory that is designed to account for such findings, fuzzy-trace theory. The basic assumption of fuzzy-trace theory is that reasoners rely on global patterns, or gist. We describe the tenets of fuzzy-trace theory, and explore its implications for different theoretical conceptions of logical competence, concluding that young children possess transitivity competence. We discuss the connection between transitivity competence (cognition) and intransitive preferences (metacognition).},

If we take successful performance to be indicative of rationality-as animal researchers sometimes do (Monkeys are rational!McGonigle \& Chalmers, 1992)-we have the paradox that animals are, on this criterion, more rational than are school-age children. It is possible, however, to complete 5-term transitive tasks by recruiting associative rather than logical processes; and, indeed, the tasks given to animals not only afford associative solutions but seem to require them (M\&C tasks, after McGonigle \& Chalmers, 1992). We asked whether 5- to 6-year-old children find a task that naturally affords the application of a logical rule (a B\&T task, after Bryant \& Trabasso, 1971) easier to perform than an M\&C task that does not. The children found the B\&T task easiera difference that could not be explained in terms of difference in memory for the premises. This leaves open the possibility that, although children are not restricted to associative strategies when completing 5-term series tasks, animals may be thus restricted.},

	Abstract = {If relational priming is responsible for unintentional analogical reasoning, as has been suggested, it too should occur unintentionally. However, results from previous studies are inconclusive - studies that use the sensicality task usually demonstrate unintentional priming, while lexical decision tasks have failed to capture the effect without explicitly instructing participants to note and use the relational similarity in the stimuli. We discuss possible reasons for these contradictory results. Based on this discussion, we aimed to maximize our chances to find an effect by ensuring that the primes and targets elicit the same processing, by using a longer SOA, suitable for the more complex nature of the task, and by ensuring that the stimuli are good exemplars of the relations that hold between them. We present two experiments that obtained unintentional and efficient priming of relations with a lexical decision task. Participants made a lexical decision for a target pair of words more quickly when it was preceded by a similarly related pair of words, compared to an unrelated pair. Participants were not instructed to note and use the relations. Experiment 2 extended those results by showing that the effect is present even when executive working memory resources are occupied by a secondary task. Even though it turned out that the base pairs differed on semantic similarity, co-occurrence and imageability between the two conditions, these differences were not responsible for the effect. Thus, relations can be primed unintentionally and efficiently, even when relational integration is not necessitated by task demands.},

	Abstract = {In evaluative priming, positive or negative primes facilitate reactions to targets that share the same valence. While this effect is commonly explained as reflecting invariant structures in semantic long-term memory or in the sensorimotor system, the present research highlights the role of integrativity in evaluative priming. Integrativity refers to the ease of integrating two concepts into a new meaningful compound representation. In extended material tests using paired comparisons from two pools of positive and negative words, we show that evaluative congruity is highly correlated with integrativity. Therefore, in most priming studies, congruity and integrativity are strongly confounded. When both aspects are disentangled by manipulating congruity and integrativity orthogonally, three priming experiments show that evaluative-priming effects were confined to integrative prime-target pairs. No facilitation of prime-congruent targets was obtained for non-integrative stimuli. These findings are discussed from a broader perspective on priming conceived as flexible, context-dependent, and serving a generative adaptation function.},

In Experiments 1 and 2, the task was indeed validated as a proper measure of relational integration, since participants' performance depended on the number of bindings that had to be constructed in the diverse conditions of the task, whereas neither the number of objects to be bound nor the amount of elicited interference could affect this performance. In Experiment 3, by means of structural equation modeling and variance partitioning, the relation integration task was found to be the strongest predictor of fluid reasoning, explaining variance above and beyond the amounts accounted for by four other kinds of well-established working memory tasks.},

The lack of theory-driven, systematic approaches and (occasionally serious) methodological shortcomings complicates this debate even more. This review suggests two general mechanisms mediating transfer effects that are (or are not) observed after working memory training: enhanced working memory capacity, enabling people to hold more items in working memory than before training, or enhanced efficiency using the working memory capacity available (e.g., using chunking strategies to remember more items correctly). We then highlight multiple factors that could influence these mechanisms of transfer and thus the success of training interventions. These factors include (1) the nature of the training regime (i.e., intensity, duration, and adaptivity of the training tasks) and, with it, the magnitude of improvements during training, and (2) individual differences in age, cognitive abilities, biological factors, and motivational and personality factors. Finally, we summarize the findings revealed by existing training studies for each of these factors, and thereby present a roadmap for accumulating further empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of working memory training in a systematic way.},

Children of both ages chose to activate a cause which could produce an effective causal mediator over an alternative cause which could produce an ineffective causal mediator. The five-year-olds in addition correctly identified the impossibility of producing the effect without an appropriate causal mediator and often mentioned the causal mediator explicitly in verbal justifications of their responses.

It is argued that the evidence of reasoning experiments suggests a negative answer to all three questions. This conclusion is interesting, since the last two questions at least might be answered affirmatively by common sense, and affirmative answers would be more consistent with the assumptions of many psychologists in related fields. The question is raised, however, as to whether experimental studies have good external validity for the measurement of 'reasoning' as we would generally understand the term.},

	Abstract = {Fuzzy trace theory explains why children do not have to use rules of logic or premise information to infer transitive relationships. Instead, memory of the premises and performance on transitivity tasks is explained by a verbatim ability and a gist ability. Until recently, the processes involved in transitive reasoning and memory of the premises were studied by comparing mean performance in fixed-age groups. In this study, an individual-difference model of fuzzy trace theory for transitive reasoning was formulated and tested on a sample (N=409) of 4- to 13-year-old children. Tasks were used which differed with respect to presentation ordering and position ordering. From this individual-difference model expectations could be derived about the individual performance on memory and transitivity test-pairs. The multilevel latent class model was used to fit the formalized individual-difference fuzzy trace theory to the sample data. The model was shown to fit the data to a large extent. The results showed that verbatim ability and gist ability drove the activation of verbatim and gist traces, respectively, and that children used combinations of these traces to solve memory tasks (testing memory of the premises) and transitivity tasks. Task format had a stronger effect on transitivity task performance than on memory of the premises. Development of gist ability was found to be faster than development of verbatim ability. Another important finding was that some children remembered the premise information correctly but were not able to infer the transitive relationship, even though the premises provided all the necessary information. This contradicts Trabasso's linear ordering theory which posits that memory of the premises is sufficient to infer transitive relationships.},

	Abstract = {Living in large, stable social groups is often considered to favor the evolution of enhanced cognitive abilities, such as recognizing group members, tracking their social status and inferring relationships among them.1\textendash{}4 An individual's place in the social order can be learned through direct interactions with others, but conflicts can be time-consuming and even injurious. Because the number of possible pairwise interactions increases rapidly with group size, members of large social groups will benefit if they can make judgments about relationships on the basis of indirect evidence.5 Transitive reasoning should therefore be particularly important for social individuals, allowing assessment of relationships from observations of interactions among others. Although a variety of studies have suggested that transitive inference may be used in social settings,6\textendash{}10 the phenomenon has not been demonstrated under controlled conditions in animals. Here we show that highly social pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) draw sophisticated inferences about their own dominance status relative to that of strangers that they have observed interacting with known individuals. These results directly demonstrate that animals use transitive inference in social settings and imply that such cognitive capabilities are widespread among social species.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments examined whether individual differences in prejudice are associated with different reasoning styles when targets and nontargets of prejudice are processed in the same context. High-prejudice and low-prejudice participants studied pairwise relations between four persons (one a prejudice target, three nontargets). Stereotypes were made salient by using specific ethnic names and stereotypic traits to define relations between the targets. Relations between the persons were always stereotype congruent in Experiment 1, whereas they were sometimes stereotype incongruent in Experiment 2. We examined study time, relational memory, and transitive reasoning in both experiments. The results of both experiments indicated that the high-prejudice participants studied sets of relations presented to them faster than did the low-prejudice participants. The high-prejudice participants were also more likely to show impaired relational memory and reasoning about nontarget persons but no such limitations with respect to target persons. This novel evidence that prejudice might substantially impair memory and transitive reasoning processes about nontarget persons is discussed in the light of alternative theoretical frameworks in the social cognition and emotion domains.

Instead, we propose anoperational semantictheory of reasoning, according to which reasoning is based on children's operational understanding of key terms in a given problem. We then go on to consider an important recent developmental theory of reasoning, fuzzy-trace theory. In order to illustrate the view of reasoning proposed here we report a study of class inclusion. Dramatic differences in class inclusion performance were found as the result of linguistic context; performance was significantly higher when an explicit request for a subclass comparison preceded the class inclusion question as compared to a standard condition when the class inclusion question alone was asked. This was the case, however, only when the prior subclass comparison question referred to the same dimensions as the class inclusion question and not when irrelevant subclasses were referred to. Children's performance was also better when they sorted the materials into the supraordinate class as compared to the subclasses, but not when the experimenter sorted them for the child. These effects due to the operational and linguistic manipulations are discussed in terms of a generaloperational semantictheory of reasoning.},

First, a methodological variable (spatial-magnitude correlations) that Chapman and Lindenberger deem to be essential to findings of memory independence appears to be irrelevant to such findings. Second, their own data favor memory independence when properly analyzed. Third, some of Chapman and Lindenberger's theoretical proposals, particularly regarding fuzzy-trace theory's analysis of reasoning-remembering relationships in cognitive development, conflict with statements in the cited references.

The authors conclude that demonstrations of response independence do not, by themselves, provide sufficient grounds for deciding whether a single process or multiple processes is necessary to account for performance. Instead, they argue that formal models are necessary if findings of (in)dependence are to be interpreted meaningfully in terms of underlying theoretical processes.

	Abstract = {This paper attempts to examine the underlying structure of analogical reasoning in decision making. The immediate (but not exclusive) context is the form of reasoning commonly seen as prevalent in common-law judicial decision making. Following Wittgenstein and Strawson the paper identifies the problem of the contingency of transitivity of analogical relations as a serious impediment to analogical reasoning. It then proceeds to offer a method of translation that delineates the borders of contingency and analyticity of transitivity in such cases, as well as proposes how these borders may be manipulated. The theoretical insight is to treat analogical relations anaphorically, as ``propredicates''. Accordingly, the translation involves constructive functional transformation from the form of meaning as continuum to the form of meaning as n-chotomies. Greimasian semiotics are then critically applied to examine in what sense ``translation'' \textendash{}in this specific sense \textendash{} can count as the ``deep structure'' of analogical/transitive reasoning, and what such a claim entails in terms of linguistic ideology. Although the model of translation is formal it is not acontextual, and must be supplemented by importation of constitutive practical considerations (i.e. norms) from concrete decision-making contexts. As such this is a case study of the pragmatic functions of formalization \textendash{} a conception that may seem alien to some. When determining which states-of-affairs are deemed compatible, the formal model is shown to serve as a framework to what eventually becomes a pragmatic device.},

	Abstract = {Not only humans but also nonhuman animals show logical and illogical behavior. There are two typical areas of evidence for this: transitive inference and the formation of equivalence relations. Transitive inference has been observed in a broad range of subjects, suggesting that they share the evolutionary reasons that support transitive inference. On the other hand, while the formation of equivalence relations is typically found in human subjects, it appears to occur rarely in nonhuman subjects. In the case of pigeons, even if they are trained explicitly in equivalence, they do not subsequently exhibit equivalence relations. The performance of the sea lion represents the most reliable evidence of equivalence relations in nonhumans, suggesting that species-specific ecological properties support this particular cognition. These evidences suggest that in searching for the origin of logic, we should examine not only ontogenetic history, but also the phylogenetic history of the subjects.},

In recent years, an increasing number of developmental studies have utilized the paradigm to test for age differences in the mental resource requirements of various cognitive tasks. The present paper reviews the findings from the developmental secondary-task research and discuss the various assumptions which underlie the use of the secondary-task paradigm to test for age differences in resource demands. The results reviewed suggest that there are age-related differences during childhood in the amount of cognitive resources required to perform a variety of cognitive tasks and to execute a variety of cognitive operations. However, many of the methodological and theoretical assumptions upon which these conclusions are based are open to challenge. It is concluded that, in the future, researchers using secondary-task procedures should make more of an attempt to validate their conclusions through the use of convergent operations.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this fMRI study was to examine how well developmental improvements in reasoning ability can be explained by changes in functional connectivity between specific nodes in prefrontal and parietal cortices. To this end, we examined connectivity within the lateral fronto-parietal network (LFPN) and its relation to reasoning ability in 132 children and adolescents aged 6\textendash{}18 years, 56 of whom were scanned twice over the course of 1.5 years. Developmental changes in strength of connections within the LFPN were most prominent in late childhood and early adolescence. Reasoning ability was related to functional connectivity between left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), but only among 12\textendash{}18-year olds. For 9\textendash{}11-year olds, reasoning ability was most strongly related to connectivity between left and right RLPFC; this relationship was mediated by working memory. For 6\textendash{}8-year olds, significant relationships between connectivity and performance were not observed; in this group, processing speed was the primary mediator of improvement in reasoning ability. We conclude that different connections best support reasoning at different points in development and that RLPFC-IPL connectivity becomes an important predictor of reasoning during adolescence.},

@phdthesis{drummond1992,
	Abstract = {This research was designed to explore the nature of reasoning. In
general, three categories of theories about reasoning (the inferential rule
approach, the mental models approach, and the operational constructive
approach) are used to explain reasoning. In this research, a simple transitivity
of length task was selected as the experimental vehicle to explore these
approaches for their veracity. Each approach was assessed for spatial and
linguistic conditions which might influence reasoning about transitive length
relations. The length difference under consideration in the reasoning task, the
order in which the premise statements about the length differences were
presented and the linguistic relational term used to describe the length
difference were selected as the experimental variables. Three measures of
reasoning about transitive length relations were assessed: judgements,
judgements-plus-justifications, and necessity understanding.
A between-within factorial, cross-sectional design was employed. The
order of the premise statements (optimal/control) was manipulated as the
experimental between-subjects factor. The two experimental within-subjects
factors, length difference (large/small) and linguistic relational term
(``longer''/''shorter''), were fully crossed and counterbalanced. Ninety-six
preschool and school-age children, evenly divided by gender and age (5-6
years, 7-8 years, 9-10 years), participated in the study.
The developmental character of transitive reasoning in the age range
studied was confirmed for two of the three measures of reasoning. More
failures of judgement were observed when a large length difference was
matched with the linguistic relational term ``longer'' and when a small length
difference was matched with the linguistic relational term ``shorter'' than when
the length differences and relational terms were mismatched. The arrangement
of the premise figure did indirectly influence any measure of transitive
reasoning but a large length difference in combination with the control premise
figure was found to increase the frequency of transitive judgements-plus
justifications.
It is concluded from the analysis of the findings of this research that
transitive reasoning about length is likely to result from constructive processes,
rather then from application of logical rules. However, it is unclear whether the
constructive processes in question are best explained in terms of cognitive
operations or in terms of figurative mental models.},

	Abstract = {Although growing up in stressful conditions can undermine mental abilities, people in harsh environments may develop intact, or even enhanced, social and cognitive abilities for solving problems in high-adversity contexts (i.e. `hidden talents'). We examine whether childhood and current exposure to violence are associated with memory (number of learning rounds needed to memorize relations between items) and reasoning performance (accuracy in deducing a novel relation) on transitive inference tasks involving both violence-relevant and violence-neutral social information (social dominance vs. chronological age). We hypothesized that individuals who had more exposure to violence would perform better than individuals with less exposure on the social dominance task. We tested this hypothesis in a preregistered study in 100 Dutch college students and 99 Dutch community participants. We found that more exposure to violence was associated with lower overall memory performance, but not with reasoning performance. However, the main effects of current (but not childhood) exposure to violence on memory were qualified by significant interaction effects. More current exposure to neighborhood violence was associated with worse memory for age relations, but not with memory for dominance relations. By contrast, more current personal involvement in violence was associated with better memory for dominance relations, but not with memory for age relations. These results suggest incomplete transfer of learning and memory abilities across contents. This pattern of results, which supports a combination of deficits and `hidden talents,' is striking in relation to the broader developmental literature, which has nearly exclusively reported deficits in people from harsh conditions.

	Abstract = {There is an important hemispheric distinction in the functional organization of prefrontal cortex (PFC) that has not been fully recognized and explored. Research with split-brain patients provides considerable evidence for a left hemisphere ``interpreter'' that abhors indeterminacy and automatically draws inferences to complete patterns (real or imaginary). It is suggested that this ``interpreter'' function may be a byproduct of the linguistic capabilities of the left hemisphere. This same literature initially limited the role of the right hemisphere to little more than visual organization. Recent reviews have garnered evidence for several different roles for the right prefrontal cortex in reasoning, problem solving, and decision-making. We here focus on the beneficial but neglected role of indeterminacy in real-world problem solving and argue that the right PFC complements the left PFC ``interpreter'' by maintaining, and even enhancing indeterminacy. Successful real-world functioning is a delicate balancing act between these two systems.},

Children 7, 9, and 11 years of age were given problems requiring judgments about friendship and about nonfriends (children who were quarreling with each other) in two different social contexts. No correlations were found between social judgments and judgments concerning length. Both type of relation and context influenced judgments about social relations.

	Abstract = {The ability to reason about relations is relevant for many spatial cognitive processes. This can involve: (i) to represent spatial information mentally, (ii) to manipulate the spatial representation, and (iii) to infer new spatial information. Several cognitive theories make assumptions and predictions about the underlying processes. A detailed and systematic overview and analysis of ireliable effects across studies is missing. This article presents a meta-analysis of 35 studies about spatial relational reasoning. Studies were classified according to different factors including the ambiguity of the spatial description, i.e., if it the description allows for more than one representation, the presentation of information, i.e., if the information has been presented auditorily or in a written form, and the task, i.e., if a conclusion or model of the premises needs to be generated or verified. Implications of the findings for the mental model theory and working memory are discussed.},

@article{turner2015,
	Abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that reasoning in humans relies on a number of related processes whose neural loci are largely lateralized to one hemisphere or the other. A recent review of this evidence concluded that the patterns of lateralization observed are organized according to two complementary tendencies. The left hemisphere attempts to reduce uncertainty by drawing inferences or creating explanations, even at the cost of ignoring conflicting evidence or generating implausible explanations. Conversely, the right hemisphere aims to reduce conflict by rejecting or refining explanations that are no longer tenable in the face of new evidence. In healthy adults, the hemispheres work together to achieve a balance between certainty and consistency, and a wealth of neuropsychological research supports the notion that upsetting this balance results in various failures in reasoning, including delusions. However, support for this model from the neuroimaging literature is mixed. Here, we examine the evidence for this framework from multiple research domains, including an activation likelihood estimation analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of reasoning. Our results suggest a need to either revise this model as it applies to healthy adults or to develop better tools for assessing lateralization in these individuals.},

Initially relational reasoning studies that have investigated the neural basis of abstract reasoning with an emphasis on the prefrontal cortex are described. Next studies of analogical reasoning are reviewed with insights from neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies. Additionally, studies of cognitive components in analogical reasoning are described. This review draws together insights from numerous studies and concludes that prefrontal areas exhibit domain independence in relational reasoning, while posterior areas within the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes show evidence of domain dependence in reasoning.

	Abstract = {Relational reasoning, the ability to discern meaningful patterns within otherwise unconnected information, is regarded as central to human learning and cognition and as particularly critical for those functioning in today's information age. However, the literature on this foundational ability is currently housed within a range of domains of inquiry, where divergent terminology and methodologies are commonplace. This dispersion has made it difficult to harness the power of existing work to inform future research or guide educational practice. In order to address this lack of consolidation, a systematic review of relational reasoning was undertaken. Specifically, 109 empirical studies dealing with relational reasoning in general or one of four manifestations (i.e., analogy, anomaly, antinomy, and antithesis) were analyzed. Resulting data revealed trends across fields of inquiry, including a degree of conceptual ambiguity, conceptual and operational misalignment, and a lack of ecological validity in certain research paradigms. There were also particular forms and measures of relational reasoning that were more commonly investigated, as well as certain domains that were more often studied. Implications for how future research can examine relational reasoning as a multidimensional construct within educational contexts are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The authors review spontaneous manipulation and spatial problem solving by capuchin monkeys to illuminate the nature of relational reasoning (wherein two or more elements of a problem or situation are considered together to arrive at a course of action) that these monkeys use in goal-directed activity. Capuchin monkeys master problems with one, two, or three spatial relations, and if more than one relation, at least two relations may be managed concurrently. They can master static and dynamic relations and, with sufficient practice, can produce specific spatial relations through both direct and distal action. Examining capuchins' spatial problem-solving behavior with objects in the framework of a spatial relational reasoning model leads to new interpretations of previous studies with these monkeys and other nonhuman animals. The model produces a variety of testable predictions concerning the contribution of relational properties to spatial reasoning. It also provides conceptual linkages with neurological processes and cognitive analyses of physical reasoning. Understanding relational spatial reasoning, including tool use, in a wider view is vital to informed, principled comparison of problem solving and the use of technology across species, across ages within species, and across eras in human prehistory.},

	Abstract = {To investigate maturational plasticity of fluid cognition systems, functional brain imaging was undertaken in healthy 8\textendash{}19 year old participants while completing visuospatial relational reasoning problems similar to Raven's matrices and current elementary grade math textbooks. Analyses revealed that visuospatial relational reasoning across this developmental age range recruited activations in the superior parietal cortices most prominently, the dorsolateral prefrontal, occipital\textendash{}temporal, and premotor/supplementary cortices, the basal ganglia, and insula. There were comparable activity volumes in left and right hemispheres for nearly all of these regions. Regression analyses indicated increasing activity predominantly in the superior parietal lobes with developmental age. In contrast, multiple anterior neural systems showed significantly less activity with age, including dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal, paracentral, and insula cortices bilaterally, basal ganglia, and particularly large clusters in the midline anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortex, left middle cingulate/supplementary motor cortex, left insulaputamen, and left caudate. Findings suggest that neuromaturational changes associated with visuospatial relational reasoning shift from a more widespread fronto-cingulate-striatal pattern in childhood to predominant parieto-frontal activation pattern in late adolescence.},

	Abstract = {The human brain possesses a unique capacity to reason about abstract relationships among items in our environment. The neural organization of reasoning abilities has remained elusive. Two approaches toward investigating human reasoning have involved studying visuo-spatial reasoning abilities and studying analogical reasoning. These approaches have both revealed anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) involvement, but no prior studies have jointly investigated these two forms of reasoning to understand any potential convergence of activation within the PFC. Using fMRI, we tested the extent to which these two forms of reasoning (visuo-spatial and analogical) overlap in PFC activation. We conducted a visuo-spatial reasoning task that required processing multiple changes across three abstract pictures. This task activated a progressively anterior series of PFC regions when multiple relations had to be integrated. We also conducted a four-term analogy task in a stage-wise manner and compared results from this task to semantic and perceptual control conditions that did not require integrating relations across the problems. We found greater activation for analogical reasoning in the series of PFC regions that were sequentially involved in the visuo-spatial reasoning task. These findings indicate that stages of neural processing overlap for different domains within human reasoning. The pattern of differences across the analogy task suggests a hierarchical organization for relational reasoning across domains in which posterior frontal cortex is active across concrete reasoning tasks, while progressively more anterior regions are recruited to process increasingly abstract representations in reasoning.},

Simulations in LISA (Hummel \& Holyoak, 1997, 2003), a neurally inspired computer model of analogical reasoning, allow us to explore how these factors may collaboratively contribute to the development of analogy in young children. Simulations explain systematic variations in United States and Hong Kong children's performance on analogies between familiar scenes (Richland, Morrison \& Holyoak, 2006; Richland, Chang, Morrison \& Au, 2010). Specifically, changes in inhibition levels in the model's working-memory system explain the developmental progression in US children's ability to handle increases in relational complexity and distraction from object similarity during analogical reasoning. In contrast, changes in how relations are represented in the model best capture cross-cultural differences in performance between children of the same ages (3\textendash{}4 years) in the United States and Hong Kong. We use these results and simulations to argue that the development of analogical reasoning in children may best be conceptualized as an equilibrium between knowledge accretion and the maturation of information processing capability.},

Such reasoning has not been thought to be accessible to younger children. However, recently, it has been suggested that younger children's ability to understand and solve analogical problems might be developed through use of the following interventions: (a) teaching relational familiarity: familiarizing children with the relations upon which analogical reasoning rests, such as causal relations; (b) teaching relational language: teaching children to understand analogical relations through use of language, such as assigning labels and names like daddy, mommy and baby for big, medium, and small, respectively; (c) relational training: training children to understand the relations upon which solutions to analogical problems rely; and (d) teaching comparison across instances: giving children experiences with analogies by exposing them to several examples of analogical problems and their solutions. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature that describes the factors that may interfere with children's ability to solve analogies and the interventions that may improve analogical reasoning ability in young children.},

In this investigation, the measurement of relational reasoning unfolded in three stages. Stage 1 entailed the establishment of a research-based conceptualization of the construct and the development of a corresponding Test of Relational Reasoning (TORR). Stage 2 focused on the reliability and validity of data from the TORR. Analyses showed the data from the TORR to be reliable indicators of students' ability to reason relationally, and TORR performance predicted students' performance on SAT verbal and math problems. Stage 3 examined the underlying structure of the construct through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Of the three CFA models tested, models with dedicated factors for analogical, anomalous, antinomous, and antithetical reasoning were deemed the best fit for the data.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies with brain-injured patients have suggested that language abilities are necessary for complex problem solving, even when tasks are non-verbal. In the current study, we tested this notion by analyzing behavioral and neuroimaging data from a large group of left-hemisphere stroke patients (n = 107) suffering from a range of language impairment from none to severe. Patients were tested on the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM), a non-verbal test of reasoning that requires participants to complete a visual pattern or sequence with one of six possible choices. For some items, the solution could be determined by visual pattern-matching, but other items required more complex, relational reasoning. As predicted, performance on the relational-reasoning items was disproportionately affected in language-impaired patients with aphasia, relative to non-aphasic, left-hemisphere patients. A voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) procedure was used to relate patients' RCPM performance with areas of damage in the brain. Results showed that deficits on the relational reasoning problems were associated with lesions in the left middle and superior temporal gyri, regions essential for language processing, as well as in the left inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, the visual pattern-matching condition was associated with lesions in posterior portions of the left hemisphere that subserve visual processing, namely, occipital and inferotemporal cortex. These findings provide compelling support for the idea that language is critical for higher-level reasoning and problem-solving.},

	Abstract = {Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is part of a frontoparietal network of regions involved in relational reasoning, the mental process of working with relationships between multiple mental representations. RLPFC has shown functional and structural changes with age, with increasing specificity of left RLPFC activation for relational integration during development. Here, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to investigate changes in effective connectivity during a relational reasoning task through the transition from adolescence into adulthood. We examined fMRI data of 37 healthy female participants (11\textendash{}30 years old) performing a relational reasoning paradigm. Comparing relational integration to the manipulation of single relations revealed activation in five regions: the RLPFC, anterior insula, dorsolateral PFC, inferior parietal lobe, and medial superior frontal gyrus. We used a new exhaustive search approach and identified a full DCM model, which included all reciprocal connections between the five clusters in the left hemisphere, as the optimal model. In line with previous resting state fMRI results, we showed distinct developmental effects on the strength of long-range frontoparietal versus frontoinsular short-range fixed connections. The modulatory connections associated with relational integration increased with age. Gray matter volume in left RLPFC, which decreased with age, partly accounted for changes in fixed PFC connectivity. Finally, improvements in relational integration performance were associated with greater modulatory and weaker fixed PFC connectivity. This pattern provides further evidence of increasing specificity of left PFC function for relational integration compared to the manipulation of single relations, and demonstrates an association between effective connectivity and performance during development.

	Abstract = {We explore the developmental trajectory and underlying mechanisms of abstract relational reasoning. We describe a surprising developmental pattern: Younger learners are better than older ones at inferring abstract causal relations. Walker and Gopnik (2014) demonstrated that toddlers are able to infer that an effect was caused by a relation between two objects (whether they are the same or different), rather than by individual kinds of objects. While these findings are consistent with evidence that infants recognize same-different relations, they contrast with a large literature suggesting that older children tend to have difficulty inferring these relations. Why might this be? In Experiment 1a, we demonstrate that while younger children (18\textendash{}30-month-olds) have no difficulty learning these relational concepts, older children (36\textendash{}48-month-olds) fail to draw this abstract inference. Experiment 1b replicates the finding with 18\textendash{}30-month-olds using a more demanding intervention task. Experiment 2 tests whether this difference in performance might be because older children have developed the general hypothesis that individual kinds of objects are causal \textendash{} the high initial probability of this alternative hypothesis might override the data that favors the relational hypothesis. Providing additional information falsifying the alternative hypothesis improves older children's performance. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrates that prompting for explanations during learning also improves performance, even without any additional information. These findings are discussed in light of recent computational and algorithmic theories of learning.},

Changes in DTI measures, principally increases in fractional anisotropy (FA), have been observed following training programs as diverse as juggling, meditation, and working memory. Here, we sought to test whether three months of reasoning training could alter white matter microstructure. We recruited participants (n=23) who were enrolled in a course to prepare for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), a test that places strong demands on reasoning skills, as well as age- and IQ-matched controls planning to take the LSAT in the future (n=22). DTI data were collected at two scan sessions scheduled three months apart. In trained participants but not controls, we observed decreases in radial diffusivity (RD) in white matter connecting frontal cortices, and in mean diffusivity (MD) within frontal and parietal lobe white matter. Further, participants exhibiting larger gains on the LSAT exhibited greater decreases in MD in the right internal capsule. In summary, reasoning training altered multiple measures of white matter structure in young adults. While the cellular underpinnings are unknown, these results provide evidence of experience-dependent white matter changes that may not be limited to myelination.},

In Experiment 2 they find direct evidence for a specialized neural apparatus recruited specifically for social relational inferences. When making social inferences, functional magnetic resonance imaging results indicate that the brain regions that play a general role in logical reasoning (e.g., hippocampi, parietal cortices, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) are supplemented by regions that specialize in representing people's mental states (e.g., posterior superior temporal sulcus, temporo-parietal junction, and medial prefrontal cortex).},

Yet, research has typically investigated performance over processing, particularly when examining the role of factors such as working memory capacity. Moreover, studies have focused on analogical reasoning to the exclusion of other identified relational forms (i.e., anomaly, antinomy, antithesis). Study 1 investigates the role of individual differences in relational reasoning performance across four relational forms. Then, Study 2 identifies the highest and lowestperforming students from Study 1 to examine the probability that undergraduate students reach each of four sequential component processes of reasoning and the degree to which significant individual differences from Study 1 (i.e., visuospatial working memory) play a role in each process. Results indicate that low performing students experience particular difficulties in identifying relevant inferences and in mapping those inferences. This was due in part to the relation between working memory capacity and the processes of inferring and mapping. The outcomes from this study contribute to understandings of the sources of success and failure in reasoning for students at different levels, and identify potential entry points for intervention research.},

Looking times showed that adults first studied the possible relations between A and B and, thereafter, they moved to C and the solution set. Children, by contrast, tended to start with the C item and organized their search around this item. Children's and adults' saccade patterns differed at the beginning and the end of the trial. Children monitored their search less efficiently than adults (fewer saccades from the solution set to the A\textendash{}B pair at the end of the trial). Looking patterns associated with errors and correct trials also differed from the start of the trial, suggesting that different search strategies lead to different outcomes.

	Abstract = {Reasoning by analogy allows us to link distinct domains of knowledge and to transfer solutions from one domain to another. Analogical reasoning has been studied using various tasks that have generally required the consideration of the relationships between objects and their integration to infer an analogy schema. However, these tasks varied in terms of the level and the nature of the relationships to consider (e.g., semantic, visuospatial). The aim of this study was to identify the cerebral network involved in analogical reasoning and its specialization based on the domains of information and task specificity. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 27 experiments that used analogical reasoning tasks. The left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was one of the regions most consistently activated across the studies. A comparison between semantic and visuospatial analogy tasks showed both domain-oriented regions in the inferior and middle frontal gyri and a domain-general region, the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, which was specialized for analogy tasks. A comparison of visuospatial analogy to matrix problem tasks revealed that these two relational reasoning tasks engage, at least in part, distinct right and left cerebral networks, particularly separate areas within the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings highlight several cognitive and cerebral differences between relational reasoning tasks that can allow us to make predictions about the respective roles of distinct brain regions or networks. These results also provide new, testable anatomical hypotheses about reasoning disorders that are induced by brain damage. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1953\textendash{}1969, 2016.

Thus, this study sought to investigate the ways in which 4 forms of relational reasoning (i.e., analogy, anomaly, antinomy, and antitheses) manifested in semistructured conversations between a researcher and child about the form and function of more or less familiar objects. Participants were a nationally representative cross-sectional sample of 61 New Zealand primary and secondary students, divided into 3 grade groups: early (Kindergarten through second), middle (fourth through eighth), and late (tenth through eleventh). Results indicated that children as young as 5 years old were capable of using all 4 forms of relational reasoning in discourse. Furthermore, analysis revealed a curvilinear trajectory in the observed versus expected frequencies of relational reasoning among the groups. Finally, in terms of the individual forms of relational reasoning, analogies and anomalies occupied a smaller proportion of relational talk when children were older, whereas antinomies and antitheses occupied a greater proportion.

Given four input semantic features for each note in the melodic stimuli sequence (two of which could be internally obtained from the other two via a comparator), DORA's performance matched the behavioral data from the infant studies.

Participants judged whether analogy problems in the form A:B :: C:D were valid or invalid, on the basis of whether the relation in the A:B term matched that in the C:D term. Half of the problems contained a C:D pair semantically near the A:B pair (e.g., NOSE:SCENT :: TONGUE:TASTE), and the other half contained ones semantically far from A:B (e.g., NOSE:SCENT :: ANTENNA:SIGNAL). After an initial block without stress, participants were randomly assigned to count backward by 13 s from 1,000 while being told to go faster, or to count forward by 1 s from 0. The stress-induced participants reported a significant increase in state anxiety as compared to controls immediately after the mental arithmetic task. Stressed participants performed less accurately (as measured by d') on both near and far analogy problems, mainly due to an increase in false alarms. We were able to model the influence of semantic distance using the ``learning and inference with schemas and analogies'' (LISA) model. Our findings indicated that even mild increases in stress impair analogical reasoning. However, the decrement does not seem to directly involve the integration of relations, but rather is due to a shift in decision strategy: Under stress, people show an increased tendency to endorse analogies as valid when the terms in the individual pairs are semantically related to each other, even if the overall analogical relationship is not valid.},

	Abstract = {Adolescents are particularly sensitive to peer influence. This may partly be due to an increased salience of peers during adolescence. We investigated the effect of being observed by a peer on a cognitively challenging task, relational reasoning, which requires the evaluation and integration of multiple mental representations. Relational reasoning tasks engage a fronto-parietal network including the inferior parietal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, dorsolateral and rostrolateral prefrontal cortices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), peer audience effects on activation in this fronto-parietal network were compared in a group of 19 female mid-adolescents (aged 14\textendash{}16 years) and 14 female adults (aged 23\textendash{}28 years). Adolescent and adult relational reasoning accuracy was influenced by a peer audience as a function of task difficulty: the presence of a peer audience led to decreased accuracy in the complex, relational integration condition in both groups of participants. The fMRI results demonstrated that a peer audience differentially modulated activation in regions of the fronto-parietal network in adolescents and adults. Activation was increased in adolescents in the presence of a peer audience, while this was not the case in adults.},

Central to the Mental Model Theory (MMT), is the assumption that the human reasoning process can be divided into three phases: (i) Mental model construction, (ii) model inspection, and (iii) model validation. The MMT can be formalized with respect to a computational model, connecting the reasoning process to operations on mental model representations. In this respect a computational model has been implemented in the cognitive architecture ACT-R capable of explaining human reasoning difficulty by the number of model operations. The presented ACT-R model allows simulation of psychological findings about spatial reasoning problems from a previous study that investigated conventional behavioral data such as response times and error rates in the context of certain mental model construction principles.},

@article{banks2013,
	Abstract = {A novel explanation of belief bias in relational reasoning is presented based on the role of working memory and retrieval in deductive reasoning, and the influence of prior knowledge on this process. It is proposed that belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process. This theory explores two main influences of belief on the activation levels of these conclusions. First, believable conclusions have higher activation levels and so are more likely to be recalled during the evaluation of reasoning problems than unbelievable conclusions, and therefore, they have a greater influence on the reasoning process. Secondly, prior beliefs about the conclusion have a base level of activation and may be retrieved when logically irrelevant, influencing the evaluation of the problem. The theory of activation and memory is derived from the Atomic Components of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture and so this account is formalized in an ACT-R cognitive model. Two experiments were conducted to test predictions of this model. Experiment 1 tested strength of belief and Experiment 2 tested the impact of a concurrent working memory load. Both of these manipulations increased the main effect of belief overall and in particular raised belief-based responding in indeterminately invalid problems. These effects support the idea that the activation level of conclusions formed during reasoning influences belief bias. This theory adds to current explanations of belief bias by providing a detailed specification of the role of working memory and how it is influenced by prior knowledge.},

	Abstract = {Presenting natural frequencies facilitates Bayesian inferences relative to using percentages. Nevertheless, many people, including highly educated and skilled reasoners, still fail to provide Bayesian responses to these computationally simple problems. We show that the complexity of relational reasoning (e.g., the structural mapping between the presented and requested relations) can help explain the remaining difficulties. With a non-Bayesian inference that required identical arithmetic but afforded a more direct structural mapping, performance was universally high. Furthermore, reducing the relational demands of the task through questions that directed reasoners to use the presented statistics, as compared with questions that prompted the representation of a second, similar sample, also significantly improved reasoning. Distinct error patterns were also observed between these presented- and similar-sample scenarios, which suggested differences in relational-reasoning strategies. On the other hand, while higher numeracy was associated with better Bayesian reasoning, higher-numerate reasoners were not immune to the relational complexity of the task. Together, these findings validate the relational-reasoning view of Bayesian problem solving and highlight the importance of considering not only the presented task structure, but also the complexity of the structural alignment between the presented and requested relations.},

On a scene analogy task, both groups had adequate prerequisite knowledge of the key relations, were the same age, and showed similar baseline performance, yet Chinese children outperformed U.S. children on more relationally complex problems. Children from both groups were highly susceptible to choosing a perceptual or semantic distractor during reasoning when one was present. Taken together, these similarities and differences suggest that (a) cultural differences can facilitate better knowledge representations by allowing more efficient processing of relationally complex problems and (b) inhibitory control is an important factor in explaining the development of children's analogical reasoning.},

Yet it remains a challenge to integrate these brain-wide interactions in identifying the flow of processing emerging from sensory brain regions to abstract processing regions, particularly within PFC. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected while participants performed a visuo-spatial reasoning task. We found increasing involvement of occipital and parietal regions together with caudal-rostral recruitment of PFC as stimulus dimensions increased. Brain-wide connectivity analysis revealed that interactions between primary visual and parietal regions predominantly influenced activity in frontal lobes. Caudal-to-rostral influences were found within left-PFC. Right-PFC showed evidence of rostral-to-caudal connectivity in addition to relatively independent influences from occipito-parietal cortices. In the context of hierarchical views of PFC organization, our results suggest that a caudal-to-rostral flow of processing may emerge within PFC in reasoning tasks with minimal top-down deductive requirements.},

	Abstract = {Computational accounts have traditionally focused on mapping between structured representations as fundamental to analogical processing. However, a recent connectionist model has been used to argue that structured representations may not be necessary to solve verbal analogies. Green and colleagues (2010) have shown that brain areas associated with analogical mapping become more engaged as semantic distance increases between verbal analogy source and targets. Herein, we had participants verify verbal analogies characterized for semantic distance while we monitored their brain waves using EEG. Our results suggest that the semantic distance between the source and target of a verbal analogy does influence early semantic processing as reflected in the N400 Event-Related Potential. However, successfully differentiating valid and invalid verbal analogies engages areas of prefrontal cortex widely associated with inhibitory processing and the integration of abstract relations in working memory. Thus, it appears that traditional semantic priming alone is likely insufficient to explain the full extent of analogical processing.},

	Abstract = {Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) exhibit deficits in executive control, which may impact their reasoning abilities. Analogical reasoning requires working memory and inhibitory abilities. In this study, we tested adolescents with moderate to severe TBI and typically-developing (TD) controls on a set of picture analogy problems. Three factors were varied: complexity (number of relations in the problems), distraction (distractor item present or absent), and animacy (living or non-living items in the problems). We found that TD adolescents performed significantly better overall than TBI adolescents. There was also an age effect present in the TBI group where older participants performed better than younger ones. This age effect was not observed in the TD group. Performance was affected by complexity and distraction. Further, TBI participants exhibited lower performance with distractors present than TD participants. The reasoning deficits exhibited by the TBI participants were correlated with measures of executive function that required working memory updating, attention, and attentional screening. Using MRI-derived measures of cortical thickness, correlations were carried out between task accuracy and cortical thickness. The TD adolescents showed negative correlations between thickness and task accuracy in frontal and temporal regions consistent with cortical maturation in these regions. This study demonstrates that adolescent TBI results in impairments in analogical reasoning ability. Further, TBI youth have difficulty effectively screening out distraction, which may lead to failures in comprehension of the relations among items in visual scenes. Lastly, TBI youth fail to show robust cortical-behavior correlations as observed in TD individuals.},

The literature on working memory (WM) suggests that the capacity of the focus of attention responsible for simultaneous maintenance and integration of information within WM, as well as the effectiveness of executive control exerted over WM, determines individual variation in both WMC and reasoning. In 6 experiments, we used a modified n-back task to test the amount of variance in reasoning that is accounted for by each of these 2 theoretical constructs. The capacity of the focus accounted for up to 62\% of variance in fluid reasoning, while the recognition of stimuli encoded outside of the focus was not related to reasoning ability. Executive control, measured as the ability to reject distractors identical to targets but presented in improper contexts, accounted for up to 13\% of reasoning variance. Multiple analyses indicated that capacity and control predicted non-overlapping amounts of variance in reasoning.},

	Abstract = {Do animals form task-specific representations, or do those representations take a general form that can be applied to qualitatively different tasks? Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) learned the ordering of stimulus lists using two different serial tasks, in order to test whether prior experience in each task could be transfered to the other, enhancing performance. The simultaneous chaining paradigm delivered rewards only after subjects responded in the correct order to all stimuli displayed on a touch sensitive video monitor. The transitive inference paradigm presented pairs of items and delivered rewards when subjects selected the item with the lower ordinal rank. After learning a list in one paradigm, subjects' knowledge of that list was tested using the other paradigm. Performance was enhanced from the very start of transfer training. Transitive inference performance was characterized by `symbolic distance effects,' whereby the ordinal distance between stimuli in the implied list ordering was strongly predictive of the probability of a correct response. The patterns of error displayed by subjects in both tasks were best explained by a spatially coded representation of list items, regardless of which task was used to learn the list. Our analysis permits properties of this representation to be investigated without the confound of verbal reasoning.},

	Abstract = {The idea that reasoning is a singular accomplishment of the human species has an ancient pedigree. Yet this idea remains as controversial as it is ancient. Those who would deny reasoning to nonhuman animals typically hold a language-based conception of inference which places it beyond the reach of languageless creatures. Others reject such an anthropocentric conception of reasoning on the basis of similar performance by humans and animals in some reasoning tasks, such as transitive inference. Here, building on the modal similarity theory of Vigo [J Exp Theor Artif Intell, 2008 (in press)], we offer an account in which reasoning depends on a core suite of subsymbolic processes for similarity assessment, discrimination, and categorization. We argue that premise-based inference operates through these subsymbolic processes, even in humans. Given the robust discrimination and categorization abilities of some species of nonhuman animals, we believe that they should also be regarded as capable of simple forms of inference. Finally, we explain how this account of reasoning applies to the kinds of transitive inferences that many nonhuman animals display.},

Both binary and triadic versions of the tests were administered in both verbal and nonverbal modes to help determine whether or not any major procedural differences between the monkey version and that used conventionally in research with children might account for the monkey's apparently nonlogical solution of the problem. The main result is that children showed very similar response profiles to that of monkeys in all the conditions used. In addition, ``labeling'', direct seriation, and ``association'' post-tests suggest that nonlogical strategies can underwrite ostensibly impeccable transitive ``reasoning'' in child as well as monkey.},

Fuzzy-trace theory explains this memory-independence effect on the grounds that reasoning operations do not directly access verbatim traces of critical background information but, rather, process gist that was retrieved and edited in parallel with the encoding of such information. This explanation also envisions 2 ways in which children's memory and reasoning might be mutually interfering: (1) memory-to-reasoning interference, a tendency to process verbatim traces of background inputs on both memory probes and reasoning problems that simultaneously improves memory performance and impairs reasoning, and (2) reasoning-to-memory interference, a tendency for reasoning activities that produce problem solutions to erase or reduce the distinctiveness of verbatim traces of background inputs. Both forms of interference were detected in studies of children's story inferences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {In this article, we present a perspective on the role of the hippocampal system in generalization, instantiated in a computational model called REMERGE (recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, \& O'Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen \& Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization\textemdash{}as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.

	Abstract = {Two experiments assessed whether conceptual relations (e.g., contains: cookie jar) facilitate the retrieval of concepts (e.g., cookie and jar) from long-term memory. The CARIN model of nominal combination asserts that conceptual relations are represented with and selected from the modifier noun (cookie). Thus, the model predicts that relational integration will facilitate memory for modifiers but not for head nouns (jar). In Experiment 1, concepts were studied in pairs and were then tested individually. Recognition accuracy was higher for modifiers than for head nouns. In Experiment 2, the studied concepts (e.g., cookie jar) were tested in the context of a new pair that instantiated either the same relation (e.g., cookie plate) or a different relation (e.g., cookie crumb). Recognition was again better for modifiers than for head nouns, but only when the same conceptual relation was instantiated at both study and test. Thus, results indicate that conceptual relations (a) facilitate recognition memory, and (b) are associated more strongly with the modifier than with the head noun.},

	Abstract = {The current study aimed at applying a broad model of cognitive functions to predict performance in science and language courses at school as well as performance in a science course at university. We hypothesized that performance in science courses was predominantly related to the cognitive function known as relational integration, whereas performance in language courses should be best explained by individuals' short-term memory capacity. The sample consisted of 161 German undergraduate students who were asked to complete 33 cognitive tasks. School grades were also obtained. The analyses revealed that relational integration incrementally explained variance in science grades. Short-term memory acted as a predictor of language grades. However, mental speed was also substantially related to language grades. Predicting university exam scores revealed that short-term memory yielded an incremental predictive power. We conclude that academic performance requires different cognitive functions depending on a domain of study.},

	Abstract = {Relational reasoning, including the distinctively human capacity to see analogies between disparate situations, requires the ability to mentally represent and manipulate the relationships among concepts. Over the past decade, studies of cognitive development, aging, and neurological disease have supported the hypothesis that the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in relational reasoning. Analysis of the component processes of relational reasoning has motivated neuroimaging studies linking these components to distinct neural substrates. Studies using diverse reasoning tasks have converged on the conclusion that frontopolar cortex responds specifically when multiple relations must be integrated to solve a problem. Other subregions in the inferior and middle frontal gyri appear to be critical for resolving interference from distracting elements of the problem and for control of working memory. Mapping the components of relational reasoning is an essential first step toward understanding how the architecture of the prefrontal cortex supports human thinking.

	Abstract = {Human reasoning and creativity represent perhaps the two highest evolutionary reaches of cognition. These two capacities are distinct from each other, but research on creativity in analogical reasoning has identified a point of convergence between them at one of the farthest forward and most recently evolved reaches of the brain. Analogy is a form of relational cognition because analogies form connections that relate otherwise separate concepts. Quantitative tools for measuring the semantic distance between concepts have advanced the measurement of creativity in relational cognition (more creative relational cognition forms connections across greater semantic distance). These tools are especially useful for the emerging neuroscience of creativity. I describe this semantic-distance approach and how it is being leveraged in my laboratory and elsewhere to investigate not only differences in creative ability between individuals but also creativity as a dynamic state that varies across time within an individual.},

	Abstract = {Over the course of the past decade, contradictory claims have been made regarding the neural bases of deductive reasoning. Researchers have been puzzled by apparent inconsistencies in the literature. Some have even questioned the effectiveness of the methodology used to study the neural bases of deductive reasoning. However, the idea that neuroimaging findings are inconsistent is not based on any quantitative evidence. Here, we report the results of a quantitative meta-analysis of 28 neuroimaging studies of deductive reasoning published between 1997 and 2010, combining 382 participants. Consistent areas of activations across studies were identified using the multilevel kernel density analysis method. We found that results from neuroimaging studies are more consistent than what has been previously assumed. Overall, studies consistently report activations in specific regions of a left fronto-parietal system, as well as in the left BG. This brain system can be decomposed into three subsystems that are specific to particular types of deductive arguments: relational, categorical, and propositional. These dissociations explain inconstancies in the literature. However, they are incompatible with the notion that deductive reasoning is supported by a single cognitive system relying either on visuospatial or rule-based mechanisms. Our findings provide critical insight into the cognitive organization of deductive reasoning and need to be accounted for by cognitive theories.},

Here we investigate TI in schizophrenia (SZ), a neurocognitive disorder associated with explicit but not implicit memory dysfunction. SZ patients and healthy controls were trained on a series of learned discriminations that were hierarchically organized (A{$>$}B, B{$>$}C, C{$>$}D, and D{$>$}E). They were then tested on each training pair and two novel ``inference'' pairs: AE, which can be evaluated without consideration of hierarchical relations, and BD, which can only be evaluated by hierarchical relations. SZ patients and controls successfully learned the training pairs and correctly responded to the nonrelational AE pairs. However, SZ patients were less accurate than controls in responding to the relational BD pairs, consistent with the hypothesis that higherlevel memory processes associated with relational memory organization are impaired in SZ. The results are discussed with respect to the relational memory model and candidate neuro-cognitive mechanisms of TI.},

The role of sleep in complex associative memory is an emerging field and the literature has not yet been systematically reviewed. Here, we systematically review the published literature on the role of sleep in complex associative memory processing to determine (i) if there is reasonable published evidence to support an active role for sleep facilitating complex associative processes such rule and gist extraction and false memory; (ii) to determine which sleep physiological events and states impact these processes, and to quantify the strength of these relationships through meta-analysis. Twenty-seven studies in healthy adults were identified which combined indicate a moderate effect of sleep in facilitating associative memory as tested behaviourally. Studies which have measured sleep physiology have reported mixed findings. Significant associations between sleep electrophysiology and outcome appear to be based largely on mode of acquisition. We interpret these findings as supporting reactivation based models of associative processing.},

	Abstract = {Objective
To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying impairments in generalizing learning shown by adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Method
Twenty-one high-functioning individuals with ASD aged 12\textendash{}18 years, and 23 gender, IQ, and age-matched adolescents with typical development (TYP) completed a transitive inference (TI) task implemented using rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). They were trained on overlapping pairs in a stimulus hierarchy of colored ovals where A{$>$}B{$>$}C{$>$}D{$>$}E{$>$}F and then tested on generalizing this training to new stimulus pairings (AF, BD, BE) in a ``Big Game.'' Whole-brain univariate, region of interest, and functional connectivity analyses were used.

Results
During training, TYP exhibited increased recruitment of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), while the group with ASD showed greater functional connectivity between the PFC and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both groups recruited the hippocampus and caudate comparably; however, functional connectivity between these regions was positively associated with TI performance for only the group with ASD. During the Big Game, TYP showed greater recruitment of the PFC, parietal cortex, and the ACC. Recruitment of these regions increased with age in the group with ASD.

Conclusion
During TI, TYP recruited cognitive control-related brain regions implicated in mature problem solving/reasoning including the PFC, parietal cortex, and ACC, while the group with ASD showed functional connectivity of the hippocampus and the caudate that was associated with task performance. Failure to reliably engage cognitive control-related brain regions may produce less integrated flexible learning in those with ASD unless they are provided with task support that in essence provides them with cognitive control, but this pattern may normalize with age.},

	Abstract = {Evidence increasingly suggests individual differences in strategies adopted on reasoning tasks and that these are either verbal-propositional or visuospatial in nature. However, the cognitive foundations of these strategies remain uncertain. Experiment 1 examined the relationship between the use of working memory resources and strategy selection for syllogistic reasoning. Verbal and spatial strategy users did not differ on working memory capacity, but confirmatory factor analysis indicated that while verbal reasoners draw primarily on verbal working memory, spatial reasoners use both this and spatial resources. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between strategies and verbal and spatial abilities. Although strategy groups were similar in overall ability, regression analysis showed that performance on a spatial ability measure (Vandenberg mental rotation task) predicted syllogistic reasoning performance, but only for spatial strategy users. The findings provide converging evidence that verbal and spatial strategies are underpinned by related differences in fundamental cognitive factors, drawing differentially on the subcomponents of working memory and on spatial ability.},

	Abstract = {Currently available treatments have limited efficacy in remediating
cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Efforts to facilitate cognition-enhancing
drug discovery recommend the use of varied experimental cognitive paradigms
(including relational memory) as assessment tools in clinical drug trials.
Although relational memory deficits are increasingly being recognized as a
reliable cognitive marker of schizophrenia, relational memory performance among
unaffected biological relatives remains unknown. Therefore, we evaluated 73
adolescents or young adults (22 first- and 26 second-degree relatives of
schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy controls (HC)) using a well-validated
transitive inference (TI) experimental paradigm previously used to demonstrate
relational memory impairment in schizophrenia. We found that TI deficits were
associated with schizophrenia risk with first-degree relatives showing greater
impairment than second-degree relatives. First-degree relatives had poorer TI
performance with significantly lower accuracy and longer response times than HC
when responding to TI probe pairs. Second-degree relatives had significantly
quicker response times than first-degree relatives and were more similar to HC
in TI performance. We further explored the relationships between TI performance
and neurocognitive domains implicated in schizophrenia. Among HC, response times
were inversely correlated with FSIQ, verbal learning, processing speed,
linguistic abilities and working memory. In contrast, relatives (first-degree in
particular) had a differing pattern of TI-neurocognition relationships, which
suggest that different brain circuits may be used when relatives encode and
retrieve relational memory. Our finding that unaffected biological relatives of
schizophrenia patients have TI deficits lends further support for the use of
relational memory construct in future pro-cognition drug studies.},

	Abstract = {The ability to think logically is a hallmark of human intelligence, yet our innate inferential abilities are marked by implicit biases that often lead to illogical inference. For example, given AB (``if A then B''), people frequently but fallaciously infer the inverse, BA. This mode of inference, called symmetry, is logically invalid because, although it may be true, it is not necessarily true. Given pairs of conditional relations, such as AB and BC, humans reflexively perform two additional modes of inference: transitivity, whereby one (validly) infers AC; and equivalence, whereby one (invalidly) infers CA. In sharp contrast, nonhuman animals can handle transitivity but can rarely be made to acquire symmetry or equivalence. In the present study, human subjects performed logical and illogical inferences about the relations between abstract, visually presented figures while their brain activation was monitored with fMRI. The prefrontal, medial frontal, and intraparietal cortices were activated during all modes of inference. Additional activation in the precuneus and posterior parietal cortex was observed during transitivity and equivalence, which may reflect the need to retrieve the intermediate stimulus (B) from memory. Surprisingly, the patterns of brain activation in illogical and logical inference were very similar. We conclude that the observed inference-related fronto-parietal network is adapted for processing categorical, but not logical, structures of association among stimuli. Humans might prefer categorization over the memorization of logical structures in order to minimize the cognitive working memory load when processing large volumes of information.},

	Abstract = {Empirical research and theoretical accounts have traditionally emphasized the function of the hippocampus in episodic memory. Here we draw attention to the importance of the hippocampus to generalization, and focus on the neural representations and computations that might underpin its role in tasks such as the paired associate inference paradigm. We make a principal distinction between two different mechanisms by which the hippocampus may support generalization: an encoding-based mechanism that creates overlapping representations that capture higher-order relationships between different items (e.g. TCM) \textendash{} and a retrieval-based model (REMERGE) that effectively computes these relationships at the point of retrieval, through a recurrent mechanism that allows the dynamic interaction of multiple pattern separated episodic codes. We also discuss what we refer to as transfer effects - a more abstract example of generalization that has also been linked to the function of the hippocampus. We consider how this phenomenon poses inherent challenges for models such as TCM and REMERGE, and outline the potential applicability of a separate class of models - hierarchical bayesian models (HBMs) in this context. Our hope is that this article will provide a basic framework within which to consider the theoretical mechanisms underlying the role of the hippocampus in generalization, and at a minimum serve as a stimulus for future work addressing issues that go to the heart of the function of the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {The ability to jointly consider several structured mental representations, or relations, is fundamental to human cognition. Prior studies have consistently linked this capacity for relational integration to rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC). Here, we sought to test two competing hypotheses: (1) RLPFC processes relations in a domain-general manner, interacting with different brain regions as a function of the type of lower-level relations that must be integrated; or (2) A dorsal-ventral gradient exists within RLPFC, such that relational integration in the visuospatial domain involves relatively more dorsal RLPFC than integration in the semantic domain. To this end, we examined patterns of fMRI activation and functional connectivity during performance of visuospatial and semantic variants of a relational matching task. Across the two task variants, the regions that were most strongly engaged during relational comparison were left RLPFC and left intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Within left RLPFC, there was considerable overlap in activation for the semantic and visuospatial tasks. However, visuospatial task activation peaks were located dorsally to the semantic task peaks. In addition, RLPFC exhibited differential functional connectivity on the two tasks, interacting with different brain regions as a function of the type of relations being compared. While neurons throughout RLPFC may share the function of integrating diverse inputs, individual RLPFC neurons may have privileged access to particular representations depending on their anatomical inputs, organized along a dorsal-ventral gradient. Thus, RLPFC is wellpositioned as a locus of abstraction from concrete, domain-specific details to the general principles and rules that enable higher-level cognition.

Genetic epistemology is taken to require the joint use both of philosophical analysis, which serves to identify the logical ordering of concepts, and of empirical methods, which serve to establish their temporal ordering in children's understanding. The method of critical exploration is an empirical, even if not an experimental, method. It is used to establish not which external variables influence a child's performance but whether the conditions extracted from a philosophical analysis have been satisfied.

	Abstract = {Working memory \textendash{} including simple maintenance of information as well as manipulation of maintained information \textendash{} has been long associated with lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). More recently, evidence has pointed to an important role for posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in supporting working-memory processes as well. While explanations have emerged as to the nature of parietal involvement in working-memory maintenance, the apparent involvement of this region in working-memory manipulation has not been fully accounted for. We have hypothesized that parietal cortex, through its representation of spatial information, in conjunction with dorsolateral PFC, supports organization of information (manipulation) and the maintenance of information in an organized state. Through computational modeling, we have demonstrated how this might be achieved. Presently, we consider a pair of fMRI experiments that were designed to test our hypothesis. Both experiments involved simple working-memory delay tasks with contrasts between maintenance of information in organized and unorganized states, as well as contrasts between high and low working-memory load conditions. Two different kinds of organization, associative (grouping) and relational, were employed in the two studies. Across both studies, superior parietal cortex (BA 7) demonstrated a significant increase in activity associated with maintenance of information in an organized state, over and above any increases associated with increased working-memory load. During the delay period, dorsolateral PFC (BA 9) exhibited similar increases for both organization and load; however, this region was particularly engaged by organization demand during the initial cue period. Functional connectivity analysis indicates interaction between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and superior parietal cortex, especially when organization is required.},

	Abstract = {Relational complexity (RC) is a metric reflecting capacity limitation in relational processing. It plays a crucial role in higher cognitive processes and is an endophenotype for several disorders. However, the genetic underpinnings of complex relational processing have not been investigated. Using the classical twin model, we estimated the heritability of RC and genetic overlap with intelligence (IQ), reasoning, and working memory in a twin and sibling sample aged 15-29 years (N = 787). Further, in an exploratory search for genetic loci contributing to RC, we examined associated genetic markers and genes in our Discovery sample and selected loci for replication in four independent samples (ALSPAC, LBC1936, NTR, NCNG), followed by meta-analysis (N{$>$}6500) at the single marker level. Twin modelling showed RC is highly heritable (67\%), has considerable genetic overlap with IQ (59\%), and is a major component of genetic covariation between reasoning and working memory (72\%). At the molecular level, we found preliminary support for four single-marker loci (one in the gene DGKB), and at a gene-based level for the NPS gene, having influence on cognition. These results indicate that genetic sources influencing relational processing are a key component of the genetic architecture of broader cognitive abilities. Further, they suggest a genetic cascade, whereby genetic factors influencing capacity limitation in relational processing have a flow-on effect to more complex cognitive traits, including reasoning and working memory, and ultimately, IQ.},

	Abstract = {Depression is a disorder characterized not only by persistent negative mood, lack of motivation and a ,,ruminative'' style of thinking, but also by specific deficits in cognitive functioning. These deficits are especially pronounced when integration of information is required. Previous research on linear syllogisms points to a clear pattern of cognitive disturbances present in people suffering from depressive disorders, as well as in people with elevated negative mood. Such disturbances are characterized by deficits in the integration of piecemeal information into coherent mental representations. In this review, I present evidence which suggests that the dysfunction of specific brain areas plays a crucial role in creating reasoning and information integration problems among people with depression and with heightened negative mood. As the increasingly prevalent systems neuroscience approach is spreading into the study of mental disorders, it is important to understand how and which brain networks are involved in creating certain symptoms of depression. Two large brain networks are of particular interest when considering depression: the default mode network (DMN) and the fronto-parietal (executive) network (FNP). The DMN network shows abnormally high activity in the depressed population, whereas FNP circuit activity is diminished. Disturbances within the FNP network seem to be strongly associated with cognitive problems in depression, especially those concerning executive functions. The dysfunctions within the fronto-parietal network are most probably connected to ineffective transmission of information between prefrontal and parietal regions, and also to an imbalance between FNP and DMN circuits. Inefficiency of this crucial circuits functioning may be a more general mechanism leading to problems with flexible cognition and executive functions, and could be the cause of more typical symptoms of depression like persistent rumination.},

	Abstract = {Recent cognitive, genetic, and histological studies have highlighted significant overlap between psychotic bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Specifically, both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are characterized by interneuron dysfunction within the hippocampus, an essential structure for relational memory. Relational memory impairments are a common feature of schizophrenia, but have yet to be investigated in psychotic bipolar disorder. Here, we tested the hypothesis that psychotic bipolar disorder is characterized by relational memory deficits. We used a transitive inference (TI) paradigm, previously employed to quantify relational memory deficits in schizophrenia, to assess relational memory performance in 17 patients with psychotic bipolar disorder and 22 demographically matched control participants. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine hippocampal activity during recognition memory in patients and controls. Hippocampal volumes were assessed by manual segmentation. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found similar TI performance, hippocampal volume, and hippocampal recruitment during recognition memory in both groups. Both psychotic bipolar disorder patients and controls exhibited a positive correlation between hippocampal volume and relational memory performance. These data indicate that relational memory impairments are not a shared feature of non-affective and affective psychosis.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we examine the hypothesis that cognitive deficits in subclinical depression become especially evident in tasks that require the integration of piecemeal information into more coherent mental representations, such as mental models. It is argued that in states of subclinical depression, attempts at integrative thinking or problem solving are limited by cognitive exhaustion which prevents the use of effective cognitive strategies. This basic argument is illustrated by paradigms addressing the construction of mental models based on sentiment or linear order information. It is shown that subclinical depression is associated with a distinct deficit in integrative reasoning, but no deficits in non-integrative processing such as initial information sampling or memory retrieval. Recent evidence of a neurophysiological correlate of this specific deficit in subclinical depression is discussed in terms of the moderating role of frontal alpha asymmetry, and in terms of a specific pattern of parietal brain activation during processing of mental models. Also, a distinctive, not deficit-related, facet of depressed cognitive symptoms is proposed, indicating a possible adaptive value of defocused attention in subclinically depressed mood. This defocused attention approach is supported by experimental and eyetracking research, and by recent theoretical models and empirical evidence showing performance benefits in depression for some cognitive and creative tasks.},

	Abstract = {The ability to reason about information is an essential human capability. It is less understood from the perspective of neurocognitive processes which can serve to constrain cognitive theories by implications from neuroscientific data. Despite some progress in the last decades, some disagreement about the experimental results and the cognitive processes of reasoning with abstract relations versus visuospatial relations persist. We conducted a cross-study meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies to determine the neural correlates of visuospatial and abstract relational reasoning. We analyzed 884 stereotactic data points from 38 studies and 692 subjects. We found that relational reasoning is mediated by the frontoparietal network, especially the right precuneus and the left pars triangularis. Problems with abstract relations are processed by enhanced activation in the inferior parietal lobe, whereas visuospatial reasoning is promoted by prefrontal domains. Our results disentangle the neurocognitive mechanisms of different representational types of relational reasoning across study designs.},

	Abstract = {Relational thinking, or the ability to represent the relations between items, is widespread in the animal kingdom. However, humans are unparalleled in their ability to engage in the higher-order relational thinking required for reasoning and other forms of abstract thought. Here we propose that the versatile reasoning skills observed in humans can be traced back to developmental and evolutionary changes in the lateral frontoparietal network (LFPN). We first identify the regions within the LFPN that are most strongly linked to relational thinking, and show that stronger communication between these regions over the course of development supports improvements in relational reasoning. We then explore differences in the LFPN between humans and other primate species that could explain species differences in the capacity for relational reasoning. We conclude that fairly small neuroanatomical changes in specific regions of the LFPN and their connections have led to big ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in cognition.},

Operationally, the corresponding cognitive process can be defined as reasoning. One hypothesis is that this process relies on the reverberating activity of glutamate neural circuits, sustained by NMDA receptor (NMDAr) mediated synaptic transmission, in both parietal and prefrontal areas. We trained two macaque monkeys to perform a form of deductive reasoning \textendash{} the transitive inference task \textendash{} in which they were required to learn the relationship between six adjacent items in a single session and then deduct the relationship between nonadjacent items that had not been paired in the learning phase. When the animals had learned the sequence, we administered systemically a subanaesthetic dose of ketamine (a NMDAr antagonist) and measured their performance on learned and novel problems. We observed impairments in determining the relationship between novel pairs of items. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transitive inference premises are integrated during learning in a unified representation and that reducing NMDAr activity interferes with the use of this mental model, when decisions are required in comparing pairs of items that have not been learned.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Our memories are remarkably dynamic and allow us to reinterpret the past once new information comes to light. Gaining novel insights can lead to mental reorganization of previously unrelated events, thus linking them into narratives. The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) support integration of partially overlapping events, but the neural mechanisms underlying the reorganization of memories for the formation of coherent narratives remain elusive. Here, we combine fMRI with The Sims 3 videos of life-like animated events, which could either be integrated into narratives or not. We show that insight triggers the emergence of de novo mnemonic representations of the narratives and is~associated with increased neural similarity between linked event representations in the posterior hippocampus, mPFC, and autobiographical-memory network. Simultaneously, events irrelevant to the newly established memory of the narrative were pruned out. This process was accompanied by increased neural dissimilarity between non-linked event representations in the posterior hippocampus and mPFC and was additionally signaled by a mismatch response in the anterior hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that insight leads to neural reconfiguration of representational networks within a memory space and have implications for knowledge acquisition in educational settings.},

	Abstract = {Despite the importance of learning and remembering across the lifespan, little is known about how the episodic memory system develops to support the extraction of associative structure from the environment. Here, we relate individual differences in volumes along the hippocampal long axis to performance on statistical learning and associative inference tasks\textemdash{}both of which require encoding associations that span multiple episodes\textemdash{}in a developmental sample ranging from ages 6 to 30 years. Relating age to volume, we found dissociable patterns across the hippocampal long axis, with opposite nonlinear volume changes in the head and body. These structural differences were paralleled by performance gains across the age range on both tasks, suggesting improvements in the cross-episode binding ability from childhood to adulthood. Controlling for age, we also found that smaller hippocampal heads were associated with superior behavioral performance on both tasks, consistent with this region's hypothesized role in forming generalized codes spanning events. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of examining hippocampal development as a function of position along the hippocampal axis and suggest that the hippocampal head is particularly important in encoding associative structure across development.},

A current debate however concerns the specificity of the involvement of the IPS in representing numbers or ordinal sequences more generally. To test this specificity, we investigated whether the IPS would be activated by extensive training on an arbitrary ordered sequence. We found that the hippocampal-angular gyrus activation initially involved in learning the ordered sequences extends with extensive training to the left inferior frontal gyrus (left IFG), but not to the IPS. These results suggest that left IFG can be involved in processing ordinal information, and that there is no need for an IPS area specifically dedicated to the representation of all ordinal sequences. Instead, we propose that the locus of the representation might be determined by the nature of the stimuli rather than its ordinal nature per se.},

	Abstract = {Deduction allows us to draw consequences from previous knowledge. Deductive reasoning can be applied to several types of problem, for example, conditional, syllogistic, and relational. It has been assumed that the same cognitive operations underlie solutions to them all; however, this hypothesis remains to be tested empirically. We used event-related fMRI, in the same group of subjects, to compare reasoning-related activity associated with conditional and syllogistic deductive problems. Furthermore, we assessed reasoning-related activity for the two main stages of deduction, namely encoding of premises and their integration. Encoding syllogistic premises for reasoning was associated with activation of BA 44/45 more than encoding them for literal recall. During integration, left fronto-lateral cortex (BA 44/45, 6) and basal ganglia activated with both conditional and syllogistic reasoning. Besides that, integration of syllogistic problems additionally was associated with activation of left parietal (BA 7) and left ventro-lateral frontal cortex (BA 47). This difference suggests a dissociation between conditional and syllogistic reasoning at the integration stage. Our finding indicates that the integration of conditional and syllogistic reasoning is carried out by means of different, but partly overlapping, sets of anatomical regions and by inference, cognitive processes. The involvement of BA 44/45 during both encoding (syllogisms) and premise integration (syllogisms and conditionals) suggests a central role in deductive reasoning for syntactic manipulations and formal/linguistic representations.

In this study, we explored the role of frontal alpha asymmetry as a potential factor explaining the cognitive problems accompanying depression. Twenty-six depressed and 26 control participants completed a reasoning task and underwent 5 minutes of electroencephalography recording. In line with the previous studies, depressed people showed difficulties with reasoning but we did not observe the relationship between frontal asymmetry in the alpha band and depression. However, we found that in the depressed group the frontal alpha asymmetry index was characterised by larger variance than in the control group, and it was also a strong predictor of cognitive functioning exclusively in the depressed group. Our results point to the disruption of a psychophysiological balance, reflected in changed frontal alpha asymmetry (into more left-sided frontal asymmetry in the alpha band, reflecting more right-sided cortical activity) as a possible brain correlate of cognitive disturbances present in depressive disorders.},

	Abstract = {Math learning difficulty (i.e., MLD) is common in children and can have far-reaching consequences in personal and professional life. Converging evidence suggests that MLD is associated with impairments in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). However, the role that these impairments play in MLD remains unclear. Although it is often assumed that IPS deficits affect core numerical abilities, the IPS is also involved in several non-numerical processes that may contribute to math skills. For instance, the IPS supports transitive reasoning (i.e., the ability to integrate relations such as A {$>$} B and B {$>$} C to infer that A {$>$} C), a skill that is central to many aspects of math learning in children. Here we measured fMRI activity of 8- to 12-year-olds with MLD and typically developing (TD) peers while they listened to stories that included transitive relations. Children also answered questions evaluating whether transitive inferences were made during story comprehension. Compared to non-transitive relations (e.g., A {$>$} B and C {$>$} D), listening to transitive relations (e.g., A {$>$} B and B {$>$} C) was associated with enhanced activity in the IPS in TD children. In children with MLD, the difference in activity between transitive and non-transitive relations in the IPS was (i) non-reliable and (ii) smaller than in TD children. Finally, children with MLD were less accurate than TD peers when making transitive inferences based on transitive relations.

	Abstract = {Mental models provide a cognitive framework that allows for organizing and manipulating information while reasoning about the world. Deductive reasoning with mental models is supported by a frontoparietal network, including regions of anterior prefrontal cortex associated with relational integration, and superior parietal regions associated with spatial cognition. Based in part on this evidence, mental models are often considered spatial representations. However, studies of transitive reasoning often rely on direct perception of stimuli that are inherently spatial in content, leaving open the possibility that the associated neural representations are specific to content that is inherently spatial or concretely perceivable. Here we directly test the hypothesis that the neural representation of mental models generated through transitive reasoning relies on this same frontoparietal network irrespective of the spatial nature of the stimulus content. Specifically, participants generated three distinct mental models through a transitive reasoning task. The content within the three models ranges from expressly visuospatial to entirely abstract. Moreover, all of the mental models participants generated were based on inferred relationships that were never directly observed. Multivariate representational similarity analysis was used to assess the correlation between these to-be-learned mental models and the patterns of neural activity elicited while viewing individual stimuli after training. Patterns representative of the mental models were revealed in both superior parietal lobule and anterior prefrontal cortex. Notably, these neural patterns were highly convergent across stimulus types. These results support the conclusion that, independent of content, relational reasoning using mental models relies on neural mechanisms associated with spatial processing.},

	Abstract = {The robustness of effects indicating a spatial component associated with abstract reasoning is tested. Judgments regarding hierarchical orderings tend to be faster and more accurate when the dominant element in any pair from the order (e.g., the older, richer, etc.) is presented on the left of the screen as compared to the right (left-anchoring effect). This signature effect is investigated in three conditions (Experiment 1), each implementing a different timing regime for the elements in each pair, during learning. Thereby, the construction of a mental representation of the ordering was exposed to a potentially competing spatial simulation, that is, the well-known ``mental timeline'' with orientation from left (present) to right (future). First, the left-anchoring effect for order representations remained significant when timeline information was congruent with the presumed left-anchoring process, that is, the dominant element in a pair was always presented first. Second, the same effect remained also significant when the timeline-related information was random, that is, the dominant element being presented either first or second. Third, the same effect was found to be still significant, when the timeline-related information was contrary to the left-anchoring process, that is, the dominant element being presented always second. Experiment 2 replicates the target effect under random timeline information, controlling for color as a stimulus feature. The results are discussed in the context of a theoretical model that integrates basic assumptions about acquired reading/writing habits as a scaffold for spatial simulation, and primacy/dominance representation within such spatial simulations.},

	Abstract = {Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with deficits in fluid reasoning, which may be related to self-regulation of cognition and behavior, and requires intact attention, working memory, and inhibition skills. No functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have directly examined fluid reasoning in ADHD which is surprising given that studies demonstrate a consistent network of brain regions involved in fluid reasoning that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD. Twenty-two right-handed, non-medicated children (12 ADHD, 10 controls) ages 8\textendash{}12 years completed a fluid reasoning task during which fMRI data were collected. The primary comparison of interest was activation during the fluid reasoning compared to the control condition. Behavioral data showed that children with ADHD tended to be less accurate with faster reaction times in the fluid reasoning condition compared to controls, and were significantly less accurate in the control condition. Controls activated more than participants with ADHD in the right intraparietal sulcus and the left lateral cerebellum in the fluid reasoning condition. Results showed hypoactivation in ADHD in regions critical for fluid reasoning. These results add to the literature suggesting a role for parietal and cerebellar regions in cognition and ADHD.},

	Abstract = {We present an overview of our computational approach towards understanding the different contributions of the neocortex and hippocampus in learning and memory. The approach is based on a set of principles derived from converging biological, psychological, and computational constraints. The most central principles are that the neocortex employs a slow learning rate and overlapping distributed representations to extract the general statistical structure of the environment, while the hippocampus learns rapidly, using separated representations to encode the details of specific events while suffering minimal interference. Additional principles concern the nature of learning (error-driven and Hebbian), and recall of information via pattern completion. We summarize the results of applying these principles to a wide range of phenomena in conditioning, habituation, contextual learning, recognition memory, recall, and retrograde amnesia, and we point to directions of current development.

Much of this work was inspired by the ideas and research of Howard Eichenbaum, who made major contributions to our understanding of the neurobiology of episodic memory and the neural representation of time. In this article, I will review evidence regarding the role of time in understanding hippocampal function. This review will cover a broad range of evidence from studies of humans and nonhuman animals with a narrative arc that follows Howard's major discoveries. These studies demonstrate that the hippocampus encodes information in relation to an episodic context, and that time, as well as space, serves to define these contexts. Moreover, the research has shown that the hippocampus can encode temporal, spatial, and situational information in parallel. Building on this work, I present a new framework for understanding temporal structure in human episodic memory. I conclude by outlining current controversies and new questions that must be addressed by the field in the years to come.},

	Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that one of the functions of the hippocampus is to enable the learning of relationships between different stimuli experienced in the environment. These relationships might be spatial (``the bathroom is about 5 m down the hall from the bedroom'') or temporal (``the coffee is ready about 3 minutes after the button was pressed''). Critically, these spatial and temporal relationships may exist on a variety of scales from, say a few hundred milliseconds up to minutes. In order to learn consistent relationships between stimuli separated by a variety of spatial and temporal scales using synaptic plasticity that has a fixed temporal window extending at most a few hundred milliseconds, information about the spatial and temporal relationships of distant stimuli must be available to the hippocampus in the present. Hippocampal place cells and time cells seem well-suited to represent the spatial and temporal locations of distant stimuli in order to support learning of these relationships. We review a recent computational hypothesis that can be used to construct both spatial and temporal relationships. We suggest that there is a deep computational connection between spatial and temporal coding in the hippocampus and that both serve the overarching function of learning relationships between stimuli\textemdash{}constructing a ``memory space.''},

Memory enables flexible use of past experience to inform new behaviors. Although leading theories hypothesize that this fundamental flexibility results from the formation of integrated memory networks relating multiple experiences, the neural mechanisms that support memory integration are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that retrieval-mediated learning, whereby prior event details are reinstated during encoding of related experiences, supports participants' ability to infer relationships between distinct events that share content. Furthermore, we show that activation changes in a functionally coupled hippocampal and ventral medial prefrontal cortical circuit track the formation of integrated memories and successful inferential memory performance. These findings characterize the respective roles of these regions in retrieval-mediated learning processes that support relational memory network formation and inferential memory in the human brain. More broadly, these data reveal fundamental mechanisms through which memory representations are constructed into prospectively useful formats.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal cells contribute to memory by rapidly encoding information about the perceptual and behavioral structure of experience. This paper describes two complementary experimental approaches that illustrate two important mechanisms that confer these properties to hippocampal cells: (1) Enduring spatial memory and stable place fields each depend upon synaptic plasticity mechanisms that normally rely on the same NMDA-receptor mediated metabolic events as long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, hippocampal cells ``learn'' to encode information about the perceptual and behavioral structure of experiences. (2) Hippocampal cells encode the structure of experience and respond in a manner inconsistent with a spatial representation. Place fields are distributed heterogeneously in space, their locations are determined by nongeometric information, the population of active cells can indicate more than one location in space, and hippocampal cells encode discriminative stimuli independent of their spatial location. To the extent that the hippocampus encodes a map, it is more simply described as a memory map than a spatial map. Rather than computing spatial locations, the space it encodes is better described as a life or a problem space that encodes the history of experience into the relational structure of episodes.

However, it is unclear whether the hippocampus is involved primarily during the original acquisition of the overlapping memories, or additionally during the flexible expression of those memories during transitive judgments. Here, we demonstrated that selective hippocampal damage produced after acquisition of the overlapping memories resulted in a severe impairment in subsequent transitive inference judgments, indicating that the hippocampus does play an important role beyond the initial learning phase.

Specifically, the parahippocampal region, through direct and reciprocal interconnections with the cortex, is sufficient to support the convergence and extended persistence of cortical codings. The hippocampus itself is critical to the organization cortical representations in terms of relationships among items in memory and in the flexible memory expression that is the hallmark of declarative memory.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

	Abstract = {This study examined age-dependent deficits in the learning and memory of inferential tasks, using an established senescence-accelerated mouse model in age-related brain dysfunction (SAMP8) and its genetically related inbred strain (SAMR1). The mice learned two sets of nonspatial odor-odor pairs by association learning successively (i.e., A3 B, X3 Y, then B3 C, Y3 Z). They were tested in transitive inference (i.e., A3 C, X3 Z) and symmetrical inference (i.e., C3 B, Z3 Y). In the probe test of A3 C, X3 Z transitive inference, 1-month-old SAMP8 and control SAMR1 at the same age significantly chose the alternative based on transitive inference, but 4- and 7-month-old SAMP8 performed at a random chance level, in comparison with unambiguous inference by control SAMR1 at the same ages. During the test of C3 B, Z3 Y symmetrical inference, SAMP8 at 1 month of age made errors as frequently as control SAMR1 at the same age, but SAMP8 at 4 and 7 months of age made more errors than SAMR1 at the same ages. At 4 and 7 months of age, SAMP8 made more errors than 1-month-old SAMP8. Control SAMR1 did not show such an age-related deficient. These results indicate that SAMP8 mice have age-related learning and memory deficits in the ability to perform inferential tasks. Age-related hippocampal dysfunction is suggested to be the cause of these age-related deficits in old SAMP8 mice during the performance of inferential tasks mediated by declarative memory.

	Abstract = {After training on a set of four ordered, simultaneous, odor discrimination problems (A؉B؊, B؉C؊, C؉D؊, D؉E), intact rats display transitivity: When tested on the novel combination BD, they choose B. Rats with damage to the hippocampus, however, do not show transitivity (Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 94:7109 \textendash{}7114). These results have been interpreted as support for the idea that the hippocampus is a relational memory storage system that enables the subject to make comparisons among representations of the individual problems and choose based on inferential logic. We provide evidence for a simpler explanation. Specifically, subjects make their choices based on the absolute excitatory value of the individual stimuli. This value determines the ability of that stimulus to attract a response. This conclusion emerged because after training on a five-problem set (A؉B؊, B؉C؊, C؉D؊, D؉E؊, E؉F؊) rats preferred B when tested with BE, but not when tested with BD.

	Abstract = {The hippocampus of birds and mammals is critical for the learning of map-like memory representations of environmental space. It has been suggested that the hippocampus of rats also participates in non-spatial relational learning, including the learning of non-spatial transitive relationships among odor stimuli [Bunsey and Eichenbaum, Nature 1996]. Although transitive-like learning has been demonstrated in a variety of vertebrate species, from a comparative perspective the role of the hippocampus in this form of learning has not been tested in other amniote groups. We trained control and hippocampal-lesioned homing pigeons on a series of visual, non-spatial, go/no-go conditional discriminations and then tested them on novel transitivity probe trials. The hippocampal-lesioned pigeons were as successful as control pigeons in responding appropriately to correct and incorrect transitivity pairs. The finding that the homing pigeon hippocampal formation is not necessary for solving this serial, conditional discrimination task is important for further understanding hippocampal function across species, and represents one of the few studies that have attempted to localize a brain region responsible for the phenomenon of transitive behavior learning.},

	Abstract = {DBA/2 mice have altered hippocampal structure and perform poorly in several hippocampus-dependent contextual/spatial learning tasks. The performance of this strain in higher cognitive tasks is less studied. Transitive inference is a hippocampus-dependent task that requires an abstraction to be made from prior rules to form a new decision matrix; performance of DBA/2 mice in this task is unknown, whereas contextual fear conditioning is a hippocampus-dependent task in which DBA/2 mice have deficits. The present study compared DBA/2J and C57BL/6J inbred mice in two different contextual fear conditioning paradigms and transitive inference to test if similar deficits are seen across these hippocampus-dependent tasks. For background fear conditioning, mice were trained with two paired presentations of an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS, 30 second, 85 dB white noise) paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US, 2 second, 0.57 mA foot shock), the context was a continuous background CS. Mice were tested for contextual learning 24 hours later. Foreground fear conditioning differed in that no auditory CS was presented. For transitive inference, separate mice were trained to acquire a series of overlapping odor discrimination problems and tested with novel odor pairings that either did or did not require the use of transitive inference. DBA/2 mice performed significantly worse than the C57BL/6 in both foreground and background fear conditioning and transitive inference. These results demonstrate that the DBA/2 mice have deficits in higher-cognitive processes and suggest that similar substrates may underlie deficits in contextual learning and transitive inference.},

	Abstract = {In studies of transitive inference (TI), nonhuman animals are typically trained with the following 5-term task: A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, D+E- where the letters stand for arbitrary stimuli and [+] indicates that choice is reinforced and [-] indicates that choice is not reinforced. A TI effect is found when, given the untrained test pair BD, subjects choose B. TI effects have been found in many nonhuman species. Although reinforcement history has been posited as an account of the TI effect, it has failed to account for a variety of conditions under which TI effects have been found. A more cognitive account of TI is that organisms are able to form a representation of the series (A {$>$} B {$>$} C {$>$} D {$>$} E). In support of this hypothesis, Roberts and Phelps (Psychol Sci 5:368\textendash{}374, 1994) found that presentation of the pairs of stimuli in a linear arrangement facilitated TI performance by rats, whereas presentation of the pairs of stimuli in a circular arrangement did not. Using methods adapted from Roberts and Phelps, we trained pigeons on either a linear or a circular arrangement of stimuli with the 5-term task. Results indicated that on the BD test pair, pigeons trained with a circular arrangement did not differ from those trained with a linear arrangement. Furthermore, we found that memory for training pairs was variable and was highly correlated with degree of TI. The results suggest that regardless of how pigeons are able to represent the stimuli, choice was not affected by the spatial arrangement of the stimuli during training.},

	Abstract = {Human declarative memory involves a systematic organization of information that supports generalizations and inferences from acquired knowledge. This kind of memory depends on the hippocampal region in humans, but the extent to which animals also have declarative memory, and whether inferential expression of memory depends on the hippocampus in animals, remains a major challenge in cognitive neuroscience. To examine these issues, we used a test of transitive inference pioneered by Piaget to assess capacities for systematic organization of knowledge and logical inference in children. In our adaptation of the test, rats were trained on a set of four overlapping odor discrimination problems that could be encoded either separately or as a single representation of orderly relations among the odor stimuli. Normal rats learned the problems and demonstrated the relational memory organization through appropriate transitive inferences about items not presented together during training. By contrast, after disconnection of the hippocampus from either its cortical or subcortical pathway, rats succeeded in acquiring the separate discrimination problems but did not demonstrate transitive inference, indicating that they had failed to develop or could not inferentially express the orderly organization of the stimulus elements. These findings strongly support the view that the hippocampus mediates a general declarative memory capacity in animals, as it does in humans.},

Modulatory input to the hippocampus from the medial septum may enhance the disambiguation of pattern sequences by causing phasic changes in the relative strength of afferent input and recurrent excitation. In the models, the strength of recurrent synaptic transmission is modulated by activation of GABAB receptors. Theta frequency inputs from the medial septum cause oscillations in the levels of GABA in the model, producing phasic changes in the strength of synaptic potentials during a theta cycle similar to those observed experimentally (Wyble et al., Soc Neurosci Abstr 1997;23: 197.7). These phasic changes in GABAB suppression improve sequence disambiguation in the simulations, as previously shown with analysis of a simpler model (Sohal and Hasselmo, Neural Comp 1998;10:889\textendash{}902). In addition, tonic changes in levels of cholinergic modulation enhance the storage of forked sequences by preventing a strong influence of recurrent synapses during storage.

	Abstract = {Generalizations about neural function are often drawn from non-human animal models to human cognition, however, the assumption of cross-species conservation may sometimes be invalid. Humans may use different strategies mediated by alternative structures, or similar structures may operate differently within the context of the human brain. The transitive inference problem, considered a hallmark of logical reasoning, can be solved by non-human species via associative learning rather than logic. We tested whether humans use similar strategies to other species for transitive inference. Results are crucial for evaluating the validity of widely accepted assumptions of similar neural substrates underlying performance in humans and other animals. Here we show that successful transitive inference in humans is unrelated to use of associative learning strategies and is associated with ability to report the hierarchical relationship among stimuli. Our work stipulates that cross-species generalizations must be interpreted cautiously, since performance on the same task may be mediated by different strategies and/or neural systems.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the potential facilitative effects of prior instructed awareness and predetermined learning criteria on humans' ability to make transitive inference (TI) judgments. Participants were first exposed to a learning phase and required to learn five premise pairs (A+B{\`A}, B+C{\`A}, C+D{\`A}, D+E{\`A}, E+F{\`A}). Testing followed, where participants made judgments on novel non-endpoint (BD, BE and CE) and endpoint inferential pairs (AC, AD, AE, AF, BF, CF and DF), as well as learned premise pairs. Across both experiments, one group were made aware that the stimuli could be arranged in a hierarchy, while another group were not given this instruction. Results demonstrated that prior instructional task awareness led to a minor performance advantage, but that this difference was not significant. Furthermore, in Experiment 2, inferential test trial accuracy was not correlated with a post-experimental measure of awareness. Thus, the current findings suggest that successful TI task performance may occur in the absence of awareness, and that repeated exposure to learning and test phases may allow weak inferential performances to emerge gradually. Further research and alternative methods of measuring awareness and its role in TI are needed.},

	Abstract = {The literature on the neural basis of learning and memory is replete with studies using rats and monkey, but hardly any using pigeons. This is odd because so much of what we know about animal behavior comes from studies with pigeons. The unwillingness to use pigeons in neural studies of learning and memory probably stems from two factors, one that the avian brain is seen as radically different from the mammalian brain and as such can contribute little to its understanding, and the other that the behavior of pigeons is not seen as sophisticated as that of mammals, and certainly primates. Studies over the past few decades detailing the remarkable cognitive abilities of pigeons, as well as a newly revised nomenclature for the avian brain, should spark a renewed interest in using pigeons as models to understand the neural basis of learning and memory. Here we review studies on the pigeon's hippocampus and `prefrontal cortex' and show that they provide information not only on the workings of the avian brain, but also shed light on the operation of the mammalian brain.

	Abstract = {Generally speaking, the study of concepts in cognitive psychology is anthropocentric with respect to both content and theory. A broader comparative perspective on the various forms of concept learning not only provides a more inclusive view of conceptual behavior, but it also provides a more objective perspective from which to identify underlying processes. We suggest that several of the major varieties of conceptual classes claimed to be uniquely human are also exhibited by nonhuman animals. We present evidence for the formation of several sorts of conceptual stimulus classes by nonhuman animals: perceptual classes involving classification according to the shared attributes of objects, associative classes or functional equivalences in which stimuli form a class based on common associations, relational classes, in which the conceptual relationship between or among stimuli defines the class, and relations between relations, in which the conceptual (analogical) relationship is defined by the relation between classes of stimuli. We conclude that not only are nonhuman animals capable of acquiring a wide variety of concepts, but that the underlying processes that determine concept learning are also likely to be quite similar.

	Abstract = {This chapter presents evidence that (a) the dentate gyrus (DG) has at least three major functions, including conjunctive encoding of multiple sensory inputs, spatial pattern separation, and facilitation of encoding of spatial information; (b) the CA3 has at least three major functions, including short-term memory and rapid encoding, arbitrary associations, and pattern completion; and (c) the CA1 has at least four major functions, including temporal processing of information (temporal order memory), association across time, intermediate memory, and consolidation of new information. It presents additional evidence demonstrating that there are dissociations and associations between the DG and CA3. The dominant view of the relationship between CA3 and CA1 and short-term and intermediate-term memory is that they operate as a feed-forward sequential processing system. The more recent data, however, suggest that, for certain tasks, there are dissociations between short-term and intermediate-term memory and between the involvements of the CA3 and CA1 subregions. Yet, for a different set of tasks, both the CA1 and CA3 interact in processing of short-term and intermediate-term memory.},

	Abstract = {We used multiple conditional discriminations to study the inferential abilities of pigeons. Using a five-term stimulus series, pigeons were trained to respond differentially to four overlapping pairs of concurrently presented stimuli: A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, and D+E-, where plus and minus indicate the stimulus associated with reinforcement and extinction, respectively. Transitive inference in such situations has been defined as a preference for Stimulus B over Stimulus D in a transfer test. We measured this and other untrained preferences (A vs. C, A vs. D, B vs. E, etc.) during nonreinforced test trials. In three experiments using a novel, rapid training procedure (termed autorun), we attempted to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for transitive inference. We used two versions of autorun: response-based, in which the subject was repeatedly presented with the least well-discriminated stimulus pair; and time-based, in which the subject was repeatedly presented with the least-experienced stimulus pair. In Experiment 1, using response-based autorun, we showed that subjects learned the four stimulus pairs faster than, but at a level comparable to, a previous study on transitive inference in pigeons (Fersen, Wynne, Delius, \& Staddon, 1991), but our animals failed to show transitive inference. Experiments 2 and 3 compared time- and response-based autorun. Discrimination performance was maintained, but transitive inference was observed only on the second exposure to the response-based procedure. These results show that inferential behavior in pigeons is not a reliable concomitant of good performance on a series of overlapping discriminations. The necessary and sufficient conditions for transitive inference in pigeons remain to be fully defined.},

Normal rats readily learned to distinguish paired associates from various mispairings of the same odors, whereas most animals with parahippocampal damage failed to learn. Lesioned animals were, however, able to acquire correct responses to stimulus pairs for which an association between odors was not required. These findings extend the usefulness of olfactory learning as a model for studies of higher order learning capacity in rodents and indicate that in rats, as in humans, hippocampal areas are critical for learning arbitrary nonspatial relationships between stimuli.

In the first of these, children were asked to judge the relative sizes of animals in verbal and pictorial tests featuring the comparatives ``bigger'' and ``smaller''. A perceptual condition with actual objects was included by way of comparison. A Symbolic Distance Effect was obtained for both lexical and pictorial input. Mode differences were also observed. Pictures produced faster responses than words, and congruity effects occurred only in the pictorial condition. Although performance was similar in tests with either comparative, our subsequent experiments on both 6- and 9-year-olds reveal a significant asymmetry in the child's capacity to verify statements of relation as a function of the direction along the (size) continuum implied by the question. However, important differences between age groups also apparent in the data lead us to conclude that the older subjects develop strategies to overcome this asymmetry by translating certain statements of relation into a form more congruent with their natural modes of encoding.},

	Abstract = {We report a formal model of transitive inference based on protocols from experiments on squirrel monkeys solving the 5-term series problem (McGonigle \& Chalmers, 1977, 1992). These studies generate databases featuring transitive choice, task transfer (where at first a significant decrement is observed, and later substantial improvement without explicit training), and, finally, a Symbolic Distance Effect (SDE) based on decision-time data. Using a rule-based (production) system, we first established rule stacks at the group, then at the individual level, on the basis of triadic transfer performance first recorded in the McGonigle and Chalmers (1977) study. The models for each subject then accommodated data from the more intensive, later study with the same subjects (McGonigle \& Chalmers, 1992). We found the initial model capable of dealing with all choice and reaction-time phenomena reported thus far, with only small changes in a rule search procedure. In common with an independent assay by McGonigle and Chalmers (1992), our model-based reassessment of decision times indicates that a major source of reaction time variation is item prominence in the rule stack rather than interitem (ordinal) distance per se.},

@article{wright2001,
	Abstract = {It has often been claimed that to demonstrate transitive inference is to demonstrate a logical ability, and by implication that transitivity as a property is generally a logical entity. Both claims are considered using a theoretically driven analysis together with consideration of relevant existing experimental research and some newly reported findings. This approach suggests an account of transitivity and transitive inferential reasoning that differs not only from the classic Piagetian account, but also from the information processing account so dominant today. We begin by considering one important issue, that the ``logical'' definitional criterion can only be approached if individuals are required to demonstrate a capacity for transitive inference that is discriminative in nature. This, together with interpretation of findings from existing transitive tasks, leads to the postulate of a three-component psychological system, with the components relying on perceptual, linguistic, and conceptual subprocesses and sensitivity to simple cues. The framework is testable and accommodates important aspects of classic and modern accounts of ``transitive development'' that until now have been taken to be mutually exclusive. It also readily accommodates both human and nonhuman research, yet neither a formal logical structure nor memory in any general sense need be assigned the primary role.},

In recent years, the area of stimulus control has been expanded with the use of stimuli that are complex, extended in time or space, and incorporate or represent natural objects, events, or locations. The contributors to this unique volume have emphasized controlling functions of complex stimulus events -- such as location or duration -- and their relation to cognitive processes in animals. The chapters cover a wide array of topics, including spatial cognition, categorization, pattern perception, numerosity discriminations, imagery, and spatial tracking, thereby addressing the question of how complex events are perceived, processed, and organized. This volume goes beyond other recent books on animal cognition in that it specifically places some well-known phenomena within the context of stimulus control.},

	Abstract = {The thesis describes experiments carried out with children and squirrel monkeys designed to challenge the claim by Bryant and Trabasso (1971) that children as young as four can make genuine transitive inferences. Bryant and Trabasso demonstrated their claim using a five-term modification of classical transitivity tasks (e.g. A {$>$} B: B {$>$} C: A?C). Several experimental variations of the design of their five-term problem are reported, involving verbal and non-verbal conditions. The results of these experiments show that the transitive choice profile which obtains under specifiable conditions of training and test is attributable to psychological mechanisms which do not necessarily implicate deductive operations. Instead, the results are interpreted as support for James's (1891) distinction between "reasoning distinctively" and thought based on "associative sequence". Contrary to Bryant and Trabasso's claim, it is concluded that the solution of the five-term transitivity problem by young children is based on "empirical thinking" which in James's terms is "reproductive" rather than "productive".},

	Abstract = {300 Ss from kindergarten and Grade 1 in the Netherlands were divided into 4 age levels and administered 3 types of seriation tasks (length seriation, seriation tasks provided with salience cues, and number seriation tasks). Also, ordinal correspondence and cardination tasks were completed. Findings show that the relationship between seriation, ordinal correspondence, and cardination (as well as their sequence of development) was influenced by varying task sensitivity (i.e., encoding load of the tasks). It is suggested that with respect to the predicted sequences of development, any theory can be confirmed or disconfirmed by manipulating perceptual (encoding load) features of the tasks. Lowering the encoding load of the seriation task, by adding salience cues, produced a facilitative effect on the seriation performance.

	Abstract = {Reevaluates literature on the development of transitive inferences, particularly criticisms raised by T. Trabasso et al (1975, 1977) regarding Piaget's theory of transitive inference ability. Trabasso claims to have demonstrated that the conceptual understanding underlying transitive reasoning does not develop with age, as Piaget claimed, but can be found among Ss as young as 4 yrs of age if language comprehension and memory are controlled. In reply, the difficulty of distinguishing between the understanding of lower and higher level Ss on the basis of average performance over many trials is discussed. Instead of analyzing data from the early and later trials of the task, it is suggested that Ss' behavior be analyzed as it evolves during the tasks to assess the concepts with which Ss approach them. Neither the creation nor the use of a seriated ordering by Ss in Trabasso's tasks is considered to provide evidence against the structural developmental account of transitivity. It is concluded that there is no evidence that conceptual structures can be reduced to information-processing systems derived from conceptual structures.

The pairs were presented successively in general form xy, xz, yz with color orders balanced. Measurements were made of the frequency of occurrence of the 8 possible response patterns, 2 of which were intransitive. Frequency of intransitive response patterns decreased with age, and this decline in inconsistent preferences was related to the pattern of intransitivity involved. On the basis of the patterned distribution of responses, it is suggested that various aspects of novelty exert the determining influence on the preference behavior of younger children and that this response priority diminishes only when it comes in conflict with emergent principles of logical relation. Results are related to D. E. Berlyne's analysis of the role of collative variables in aesthetic response. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Experiments II and III, preschool (mean age = 4 years 7 months), second grade (mean age = 7 years 8 months), fourth grade (mean age = 9 years 9 months), and college students (mean age = 18 years 11 months) were administered the nonserial presentation version of the five-term transitive inference. An ontogenetic decrease in trials to learn the premises and corresponding increase in proportion correct on both premises and inferences was observed.

Subjects were trained on four operant discriminations in a 5-term series-A + B - , B + C - , C + D - and D + E - (where [ + ] denotes reward, and [ -] non-reward in choice). In unreinforced tests, choice of B over D is evidence of transitive inference formation. Training proceeded without the subjects being presented the training pairs in blocks. Results show that randomized training degrades the performance of pigeons, just as it does human subjects, but that some subjects can still respond transitively under these conditions. In addition, the results support reinforcement models of transitive inference performance.},

	Abstract = {We investigated monkeys' knowledge of the ordinal positions of stimuli that formed a 5-item serial list, \{abcde\}, with wild card items (\{w\}) that could substitute for items in the original series. In Experiment 1, training with wild cards was given on 3-, 4-, and 5-item series. In the last of these series, the wild card substitutions created five wild card sequences, \{wbcde\} through \{abcdw\}. During the final 10 sessions of training with each of 2 different wild cards (Items \{x\} and \{y\}), the 3 Ss were able to successfully complete almost 60\% of the wild card sequences. In Experiment 2, the 2 wild cards were presented on the same trial in 10 different double wild card sequences (e.g., \{axcdy\}). The 2 monkey Ss correctly completed about 59\% of the double wild card sequences during the final 2 training sessions. The performance levels achieved on single and on double wild card sequences, although well below that observed on the baseline sequence \{abcde\} (90\% or better), support the view that the monkeys possessed some knowledge regarding the ordinal position of each baseline item.

@article{halford1984a,
	Abstract = {This research had two aims. The first was to test three explanations of performance on N-term series tasks by young children: the labeling model of B.DeBoysson-Bardies and K. O'Regan (1973), Nature (London), 246, 531\textendash{}534, the sequential-contiguity model of L. Breslow (1981, Psychological Bulletin, 89, 325\textendash{}351), and the ordered array or image model of C. A. Riley and T. Trabasso (1974, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 17, 187\textendash{}202). In the first experiment, 5-year-old children were taught additional premises which would interfere with labeling and sequential-contiguity processes, but not with forming an ordered array. Reasoning performance was essentially comparable to previous results with the paradigm, thus supporting the ordered array model. The second aim was to reexamine children's ability to learn sets of premises which can be assembled into an ordered array, since there was reason to believe that previous studies had created false positives. In the second experiment, 3- to 7-year-old children were taught either overlapping (a {$>$} b, b {$>$} c, \ldots{}) or nonoverlapping (a {$>$} b, c {$>$} d, \ldots{}) premises. Overlapping premises can be integrated into an ordered array (a, b, c, d, e), but nonoverlapping premises cannot. However, the overlapping condition proved more difficult, and the success rate for preschoolers (312- to 412-year-olds) was of zero order. This raises doubts about their ability to learn a set of premises of the kind required for transitive inference. These doubts were strengthened by the third experiment which showed that when premises were not presented in serial order, preschool (312- to 412-year-old) children could not learn the premises of an N-term series task.},

@phdthesis{stjohnston1994,
	Abstract = {This thesis is sympathetic to Piaget's view of development as a dynamic interactive process between an autonomous agent and its environment allowing cognitive growth through self-regulation and resulting in an extended behavioural repertoire. This thesis explores developmental issues through computer modelling. Piaget thought transitive inferences relied on logic, which he considered the basis of rationality, and as such marked the end-point of cognitive development. More recently, empirical studies have shown that the ability to make transitive inferences does not rely on logic, and is close to the lower ontological bounds of the system, requiring us to reassess our theories for rationality, ontology, and ontogeny. Using Piagetian principles, it is argued that transitive inference is likely to be primitive, and should be applied as a default assumption for pragmatic reasons but that this assumption must be defeasible. Basic decision-making models are produced, based on Sutton and Barto's self-supervised learning models. They show how easy it is to generate a simple order over a set of binary choices leading to a strong transitive bias. Elaborating the representation in the model with units that learn stimulus-stimulus relationships, the model can also learn a circular relationship and generalise appropriately. Thus, transitivity is captured as a default yet defeasible assumption giving the agent the ability to exploit its environment as much as possible whilst still remaining adaptable. The model also shows similar scope to subjects in that its performance on triadic choices is worse than on binary ones. Unlike some subjects, the model cannot repair its own performance. Seriation is a more transparent ordering skill which develops later. Empirical work determining the basis of seriation skills showed that the important development is a data-reducing strategy, based on picking up redundant information in the task, that reduces seriation to a simple search task.},

It is suggested that these could be produced by subjects learning the frequency with which words occur as the greater member of a pair or relationship. In two experiments when subjects learned verbal discrimination lists constructed from a five term linear ordering, both effects were obtained. The pattern of errors appeared to be essentially the same on Trial 1 as it was on all trials, and did not differ as a function of whether or not the subjects were informed about the linear ordering. Furthermore, the end of the order, which was most difficult, varied in accordance with frequency predictions.

Chimpanzees constructed equivalence, order and reversibility relations within single sets of objects as well as between two or three contemporaneous sets of objects. The chimpanzees' logicomathematical operations were more advanced, including infrequent and minimal operations on three sets, than those of some previously investigated younger nonenculturated common chimpanzees. In experiment 2, six chimpanzees ranging in age from 6 to 21 years were presented with sets of 12 objects. Chimpanzees constructed more advanced operations on single sets, but not on contemporaneous sets.

	Abstract = {Examined whether a pigeon's representation of a simultaneous chain specifies an element's ordinal position, in 2 experiments using a total of 48 male White Carneaux pigeons. In Exp I, 36 Ss learned to peck 3 simultaneously presented colors (A, B, and C), in the sequence A\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}B\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}C. They then learned to produce 1 of 3 new sequences, each consisting of A, B, or C and 2 achromatic geometric forms, X and Y. Positive transfer occurred when A, B, or C retained its original position in the 2nd sequence (A\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}X\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}Y, X\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}B\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}Y, and X\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}Y\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}C). Negative transfer occurred when A, B, or C was shifted to a new position. Exp II tested an explanation of the transfer effects obtained in the case of element B that is based upon the relative difficulty of sequences containing B, X, and Y rather than knowledge of the ordinal position of B per se. Transfer effects with respect to the ordinal position of B are important because B is the 1 element that is not open to interpretations of beginning or end effects. Exp II showed that the sequence X\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}B\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}Y, in which the difficult-to-discriminate elements X and Y are separated by B, was not easier to learn than the sequences B\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}X\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}Y and X\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}Y\hspace{0.6em}\textrightarrow\hspace{0.6em}B. This result favors the conclusion that while learning to produce a 3-element sequence, a pigeon acquires knowledge of the ordinal position of each element.

	Abstract = {Five squirrel monkeys showed a significant Symbolic Distance Effect (SDE) when tested on procedures  designed to incorporate reaction  time (RT) measures within the five-term series  (``transitive  inference'')  task. Taken together with the high levels of transitive choice obtained by these subjects, this result shows that monkeys  have  met choice and  reaction  time  criteria perceived by many as indexical of ``linear   representation''. Explicit evaluation of the representational implications of the SDE was subsequently undertaken in three-choice  transfer tests, which initially revealed consistent deviations from the ranks predicted on a linear model. Extensive testing with the triadic method, however, elicited spontaneous improvement in overall choice ranking according to a linear principle. Further decomposition of the RT data showed that the irregularities in the initial transfer  behaviour are by no means paradoxical. The ordinal  separation data structure, from which the SDE is derived, masks two separate populations of scores-one fast and relatively undifferentiated, the other slow and based on judgements with poorly encoded items. And it is these factors, not inter-item distance, which, we argue, are the main determiners of the SDE. Whilst this phenomenon is thus only  weakly  indexical of principled linear representation, we contend that new (triad-based)  ranking  evidence suggests that monkeys may be capable of seriation  as well as transitivity.},

	Abstract = {All intelligence relies on search - for example, the search for an intelligent agent's next action. Search is only likely to succeed in resource-bounded agents if they have already been biased towards finding the right answer. In artificial agents, the primary source of bias is engineering. This dissertation describes an approach, Behavior-Oriented Design (BOD) for engineering complex agents. A complex agent is one that must arbitrate between potentially conflicting goals or behaviors. Behavior-oriented design builds on work in behavior-based and hybrid architectures for agents, and the object oriented approach to software engineering. The primary contributions of this dissertation are: 1. The BOD architecture: a modular architecture with each module providing specialized representations to facilitate learning. This includes one pre-specified module and representation for action selection or behavior arbitration. The specialized representation underlying BOD action selection is Parallel-rooted, Ordered, Slip-stack Hierarchical (POSH) reactive plans. 2. The BOD development process: an iterative process that alternately scales the agent's capabilities then optimizes the agent for simplicity, exploiting tradeoffs between the component representations. This ongoing process for controlling complexity not only provides bias for the behaving agent, but also facilitates its maintenance and extendibility.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides a new model of primate transitive inference learning. We begin from the production-rule model of Harris and McGonigle (1994), which was previously the best model at accounting for the performance of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and human children trained on transitive inference (e.g. given A {$>$} B and B {$>$} C, then A {$>$} C) when presented with three items from the training set. We have extended this model by creating a version that learns, and in so doing have accounted for more of the data, particularly subject's failures to learn transitive inference. We demonstrate a twotier task-learning model which, in accounting for learning the training pairs, generates `transitive inference' in pairs (but not triads) for free. In addition to replicating this aspect of the Harris and McGonigle (1994) model in a learning system, we provide a novel explanation for the difficulty in acquiring the pairs in the first place and the utility of the training regimes commonly used. We discuss the biological plausability of our model and its relationship to other popular models of the transitive inference task.},

	Abstract = {During operant transitive inference experiments, subjects are trained on adjacent stimulus pairs in an implicit linear hierarchy during which responses to higher-ranked stimuli are rewarded. Two contrasting forms of cognitive representation are often used to explain resulting choice behavior. Associative representation is based on memory for the reward history of each stimulus. Relational representation depends on memory for the context in which stimuli have been presented. Natural history characteristics that require accurate configural memory, such as social complexity or reliance on cached food, should tend to promote greater use of relational representation. To test this hypothesis, four corvid species with contrasting natural histories were trained on the transitive inference task: pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus; Clark's nutcrackers, Nucifraga columbiana; azure-winged magpies, Cyanopica cyanus; and western scrub jays, Aphelocoma californica. A simplified computer model of associative representation displayed a characteristic pattern of accuracy as a function of position in the hierarchy. Analysis of the deviation of each subject's performance from this predicted pattern yielded an index of reliance on relational representation. Regression of index scores against rankings of social complexity and caching reliance indicated that both traits were significantly and independently associated with greater use of relational representation.},

	Abstract = {Human problem solving relies on multiple strategies supported by dynamic neural network interactions. The transitive inference (TI) problem solving task can be accomplished by the extraction of relations among stimuli or by responding to reinforcement histories of items using associative learning. Relational and associative strategies are assumed to rely on the hippocampus and caudate nucleus, respectively; which compete to control behavior. However, we found that increased recruitment of both systems in TI is correlated with greater accuracy and awareness, and reduced associative responding to single items. Contrary to prior assumptions, the hippocampus and caudate interact cooperatively to facilitate successful TI. We suggest that the dynamics of the relationship between the hippocampus and caudate depends critically upon task demands. VC 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Transitive responding in hooded crows requires linearly ordered stimuli. J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 82, 1\textendash{}19], we trained pigeons to discriminate overlapping pairs of colored squares (A+ B-, B+ C-, C+ D-, and D+ E-). For some birds, the colored squares, or primary stimuli, were followed by a circle of the same color (feedback stimuli) whose diameter decreased from A to E (Ordered Feedback group); these circles were made available to help order the stimuli along a physical dimension. For other birds, all of the feedback stimuli had the same diameter (Constant Feedback group). In later testing, novel choice pairs were presented, including the critical BD pair. The pigeons' reinforcement history with Stimuli B and D was controlled, so that the birds should not have chosen Stimulus B during the BD test. Unlike the crows, the pigeons selected Stimulus B over Stimulus D in both ordered and Constant Feedback groups, suggesting that the orderability of the post-choice feedback stimuli did not affect pigeons' transitive responding. Post hoc simulations showed that associative models [Wynne, C.D.L., 1995. Reinforcement accounts for transitive inference (TI) performance. Anim. Learn.

	Abstract = {Several reinforcement-based models have been proposed to explain transitive-like behavior in nonverbal transitive inference tasks. These models assume that the initial training required for memorizing the premises produces an ordered series of associative values (A{$>$}B{$>$}C{$>$}D{$>$}E); these values can then be used to select the ``transitively correct'' stimulus in a novel pair (e.g., BD). Our study experimentally tested this assumption by using resistance-to-extinction and resistance-to-reinforcement techniques to obtain empirical measures of associative strength for Stimuli B and D. We first measured the associative strengths of these stimuli after completion of initial training with overlapping pairs of colored squares (A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, and D+E-) using resistance-to-extinction and resistance-to-reinforcement procedures. Next, we used massed presentations of Pair D+E- (termed bias reversal) that ought to increase the associative value of Stimulus D, and again measured the associative strengths of the stimuli. None of our experimental measures of associative strength correlated with pigeons' behavior in the BD test or with BD performance predicted by associative models either before or after bias reversal (Wynne, 1995, Siemann and Delius, 1998). These results question validity of reinforcement-based models for explaining animals' behavior in nonverbal TI tasks.},

Following nonarbitrary relational training and testing to establish contextual functions of ``more than'' ({$>$}) and ``less than'' ({$<$}) for two abstract stimuli, two groups of participants learned a series of contextually controlled more than or less than relations (All-More: E{$>$}D{$>$}C{$>$}B{$>$}A; All-Less: AA, C{$>$}B, D{$>$}C and E{$>$}D) and one-step (AA, D{$>$}B and E{$>$}C) and two-step (AA and E{$>$}B) combinatorially entailed relations. Performance accuracy on the trained and inferential tasks was uniformly high across both groups, with no significant differences observed. In both groups, however, performance accuracy differed significantly on one-step and two-step combinatorially entailed tasks involving the same or different relation to that trained. The present findings demonstrate complex relational reasoning with derived comparative relations, replicate several key effects from the literature on TI and have potential implications for the development of a contemporary behavior-analytic account of TI.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference has traditionally been regarded as a relational proposition-based reasoning task, however, recent investigations question the validity of this assumption. Although some results support the use of a relational proposition-based approach, other studies find evidence for the use of associative learning. We examined whether participants are biased towards a relational proposition-based approach, or associative learning, depending upon the integrity of other cognitive abilities supported by frontal and medial temporal lobes. We found that transitive inference success and strategy use are related to tasks that require processing of, and memory for, relations. Participants who showed superior memory for relations among items showed superior transitive inference accuracy, and conversely, participants who showed superior memory for single items showed inferior transitive inference accuracy. Participants who demonstrated performance patterns indicative of a proposition-based approach showed more accurate inference performance, and superior memory for, and online access to, relations among items. Participants who demonstrated performance patterns indicative of associative learning showed inferior transitive inference accuracy and superior iconic/pictorial abilities. We speculate that transitive inference performance is mediated by interactions among multiple cognitive systems that support different aspects of processing, from which the degree of contribution varies depending on underlying cognitive/neural integrity.},

	Abstract = {If Ben is taller than Emily and Emily is taller than Dina, one can infer that Ben is taller than Dina. This process of inferring relations between stimuli based on shared relations with other stimuli is called transitive inference (TI). Many species solve TI tasks in which they learn pairs of overlapping stimulus discriminations (A+B-, B+C-, etc.) and are tested with non-adjacent novel test pairings (BD). When relations between stimuli are determined by reinforcement (A is reinforced when paired with B, B when paired with C), performance can be controlled by the associative values of individual stimuli or by logical inference. In Experiment 1 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) chose the higher ranked item on non-adjacent test trials after training on a 7-image TI task. In Experiment 2 we measured the associative values of 7 TI images and found that these values did not correlate with choice in TI tests. In Experiment 3 large experimental manipulations of the associative value of images did influence performance in some TI test pairings, but performance on other pairs was consistent with the implied order. In Experiment 4 monkeys linked two previously learned 7-item lists into one 14-item list after training with a single linking pair. Linking cannot be explained by associative values. Associative value can control choice in TI tests in at least some extreme circumstances. Implied order better explains most TI choices in monkeys, and is a more viable mechanism for TI of social dominance, which has been observed in birds and fish.

Von Fersen et al proposed a local rule to account for performance. P. A. Couvillon and M. E. Bitterman (see record [rid]1992-37970-001[/rid]) provided a rationale for such a rule by pointing out that the equally reinforced central stimuli, B, C, and D, are unequally unreinforced. This article shows that many models that recognize an effect of nonreinforcement on stimulus value give similar results. Therefore, Couvillon and Bitterman's argument that nothing beyond conventional conditioning principles is necessary to account for the transitive-inference effect in pigeons is supported.

We investigated whether transitive inference accuracy can be improved by biasing strategy choice towards a proposition-based approach that relies on the extraction of relations among stimuli. We biased strategy choice by using familiar stimuli with known relations that tap prior knowledge. Semantic information led to increased accuracy for younger and older adults, and increased awareness of stimulus relations. Increased age was associated with reduced awareness. Awareness accounted for the variability in performance accuracy to a greater extent than age, as aware older and younger adults showed similar accuracies on all conditions. The current work indicates that age differences in performance can be minimized by providing semantically meaningful stimuli that bias participants to use a relational proposition-based approach.},

	Abstract = {The ability to perform relational proposition-based reasoning was assessed in younger and older adults using the transitive inference task in which subjects learned a series of premise pairs (A{$>$}B, B{$>$}C, C{$>$}D, D{$>$}E, E{$>$}F) and were asked to make inference judgments (B?D, B?E, C?E). Learning of premise pairs was related to subsequent inference performance and conscious awareness of the stimulus hierarchy (A{$>$}B{$>$}C{$>$}D{$>$}E{$>$}F). Despite extended training, age-related deficits were observed for response times, accurate learning of the premise pairs, making inference judgments, and articulating the hierarchy. When performance for younger and older adults was examined with respect to whether they were subsequently considered aware of the hierarchy, older and younger adults still significantly differed on their accuracy for studied premise pairs, but performance between the age groups was similar for the inference pairs. Successful transitive inference performance is contingent upon the relational organization of propositions within memory and such processes are impaired in aging, potentially leading to disruptions in conscious access to the stimulus hierarchy. Such findings, in concert with previous neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies, implicate an age-related deficit in the functioning of frontal and medial temporal lobe structures, with particular emphasis on the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is needed to store memories that are recon"gurable. Therefore, a hippocampal-like computational model should be able to solve transitive inference (TI) problems. By turning TI into a problem of sequence learning (stimuli-decisions-outcome), a sequence learning, hippocampal-like neural network solves the TI problem. In the transitive inference problem studied here, a network simulation begins by learning six pairwise relationships: A'B, B'C, C'D, D'E, E'F, and F'G where the underlying relationship is the linear string: A'B'C'D'E'F'G. The simulation is then tested with the novel pairs: B?D, C?E, D?F, B?E, C?F, B?F, and A?G. The symbolic distance e!ect, found in animal and human experiments, is reproduced by the network simulations. That is, the simulations give stronger decodings for B'F than for B'E or C'F and decodings for B'F and C'F are stronger than for B'D, C'E, or D'F. 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) involves using known relationships to deduce unknown ones (for example, using A {$>$} B and B {$>$} C to infer A {$>$} C), and is thus essential to logical reasoning. First described as a developmental milestone in children1, TI has since been reported in nonhuman primates2,3,4, rats5,6 and birds7,8,9,10. Still, how animals acquire and represent transitive relationships and why such abilities might have evolved remain open problems. Here we show that male fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) can successfully make inferences on a hierarchy implied by pairwise fights between rival males. These fish learned the implied hierarchy vicariously (as `bystanders'), by watching fights between rivals arranged around them in separate tank units. Our findings show that fish use TI when trained on socially relevant stimuli, and that they can make such inferences by using indirect information alone. Further, these bystanders seem to have both spatial and featural representations related to rival abilities, which they can use to make correct inferences depending on what kind of information is available to them. Beyond extending TI to fish and experimentally demonstrating indirect TI learning in animals, these results indicate that a universal mechanism underlying TI is unlikely. Rather, animals probably use multiple domain-specific representations adapted to different social and ecological pressures that they encounter during the course of their natural lives.},

	Abstract = {One adult female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) was trained to respond serially to three arabic numerals between 1 and 9, presented on a cathode-ray-tube (CRT) screen. To examine the factors affecting her sequential responding behavior, wild-card items were added to the three-item sequences. When this wild-card item remained until the subject responded to the last numeral (i.e., the terminator condition), her response to the terminator at each point of the sequence was controlled by the ordinal distance between numerals. Thus, the number of responses to the terminator increased as the ordinal distance between numerals increased. When the wild-card item was eliminated by the subject's response (wild-card conditions), the probability of responses to the wild card before the first numeral increased as a function of the serial position of the first numeral. These results were consistent with previous studies of response time and suggest both serial position and symbolic distance effects. It is suggested that the subject might form the integrated 9item linear representations by training of possible subsets of three-item sequences. Knowledge concerning the ordinal position of each numeral was established through this training.},

	Abstract = {It is widely accepted that many species of nonhuman animals appear to engage in transitive inference, producing appropriate responses to novel pairings of non-adjacent members of an ordered series without previous experience of these pairings. Some researchers have taken this capability as providing direct evidence that these animals reason. Others resist such declarations, favouring instead explanations in terms of associative conditioning. Associative accounts of transitive inference have been refined in application to a simple 5-element learning task that is the main paradigm for laboratory investigations of the phenomenon, but it remains unclear how well those accounts generalise to more information-rich environments such as social hierarchies which may contain scores of individuals, and where rapid learning is important. The case of transitive inference is an example of a more general dispute between proponents of associative accounts and advocates of more cognitive accounts of animal behaviour. Examination of the specific details of transitive inference suggests some lessons for the wider debate.},

A system for relational reasoning in human prefrontal cortex. Psychol. Sci. 10, 119\textendash{}125]. In two experiments we investigated when and how adults employ different cognitive strategies during TI by evaluating the interaction between task instructions and individual differences in working memory capacity. Participants engaged in a paired discrimination task involving a 6-unit TI hierarchy and were either prior aware, prior unaware or serendipitously aware of the hierarchical relationship among stimulus items. Both prior aware participants and serendipitously aware participants were more likely to engage in a logic-based strategy compared to unaware participants who relied upon stimulus-driven strategies. Individual differences in working memory were associated with the acquisition of awareness in the serendipitously aware group and with the maintenance of awareness in the prior aware group. These findings suggest that the capacity for TI may be supported by multiple neurocognitive strategies, and that the specific strategy employed is dependent upon both task- and participant-related factors.},

	Abstract = {The transitive inference (TI) task assesses the ability to generalize learned knowledge to new contexts, and is thought to depend on the hippocampus (Dusek \& Eichenbaum, 1997). Animals or humans learn in separate trials to choose stimulus A over B, B over C, C over D and D over E, via reinforcement feedback. Transitive responding based on the hierarchical structure A {$>$} B {$>$} C {$>$} D {$>$} E is then tested with the novel BD pair. We and others have argued that successful BD performance by animals \textendash{} and even humans in some implicit studies \textendash{} can be explained by simple reinforcement learning processes which do not depend critically on the hippocampus, but rather on the striatal dopamine system. We recently showed that the benzodiazepene midazolam, which is thought to disrupt hippocampal function, profoundly impaired human memory recall performance but actually enhanced implicit TI performance (Frank, O'Reilly \& Curran, 2006). We posited that midazolam biased participants to recruit striatum during learning due to dysfunctional hippocampal processing, and that this change actually supported generalization of reinforcement values. Greene (2007) questions the validity of our pharmacological assumptions and argues that our conclusions are unfounded. Here we stand by our original hypothesis, which remains the most parsimonious account of the data, and is grounded by multiple lines of evidence.},

However, it has remained unclear whether HC is involved in the expression of TI, or rather contributes to TI through its role in the acquisition of the sequence of elements (Frank, Rudy, \& O'Reilly, 2003). Presently, the authors compared the effects of excitotoxic dorsal HC lesions in C57BL mice that received surgery before or after they were trained to discriminate between pairs of visual stimuli. Performance on a subsequent TI task was worse in mice with pretraining lesions than in those with posttraining lesions, which showed similar performance to shams without lesions. This indicates that HC is not involved in the expression of TI, but may merely help to acquire the underlying representations required for TI.},

	Abstract = {The ability of animals to perform transitive inference is associated with social group formation and dominance hierarchies. Brain lateralization is also linked to the selective pressures associated with social life. We investigated whether transitive inference is better performed by lateralized than non-lateralized brains. In the domestic chick (Gallus gallus) exposure of eggs to light before hatching leads to the development of lateralization of some visual functions. Thus, it is possible to obtain chicks with strong (light-incubated, Li-chicks) or weak (dark-incubated, Di-chicks) lateralization. Di- and Li-chicks were trained to discriminate stimulus pairs, in order to build a hierarchy (A {$>$} B {$>$} C {$>$} D {$>$} E). Chicks were subsequently tested on stimulus pairs never seen together before (AE and BD). Li-chicks performed the discrimination BD better than did Di-chicks, suggesting that exposure to light in the egg leads to an increased ability to carry out representational learning. Moreover, lateralized chicks using their left eye only (right hemisphere) during test showed a better performance than did right eye only (left hemisphere) chicks on the BD task. Females also tended to perform better than males. Results demonstrate that chicks with lateralized brain hemispheres show greater inference, and this is under right hemisphere control: the brain hemisphere that is dominant in social interactions.},

The present research examines whether 16-month-old infants can make transitive inferences about other people's preferences. If an agent prefers object-A over B (A{$>$}B) and B over C (B{$>$}C), infants seem to reason that she also prefers A over C (A{$>$}C) (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 provides indirect evidence that a one-directional linear ordering of the three items (A{$>$}B{$>$}C) may have helped infants to succeed in the task. These and control results present the first piece of evidence that precursors of transitive reasoning cognitive abilities exist in infancy.},

Seven sophisticated macaques were trained on four five-item lists. Each acquisition selectively excluded one of the internal conditional pairs of the typical four-problem sequence (AB,BC,CD,DE) that defines a five-item serially ordered list. Then, all possible novel pairings and the trained pairs appeared together in a test. After this, the previously omitted pair was trained and animals were retested. On all tasks, initial tests revealed little organization and much intersubject variability of characteristic choice strategies, but subsequent inclusion of all four conditional pairs always yielded organized serial choice. On both the four-problem tests and in a later retention, errors were directly related to interitem distance between the objects paired on test trials. These results helped to specify the conditions required for demonstration of nonhuman primate analogs of transitivity, and showed that even sophisticated monkeys organize information in retention only if they know all interitem relationships.},

The final section of the paper poses the question whether these three processes are common to both small-scale and large-scale spatial reasoning, and if so, how those commonalities might inform our theories of cognitive architecture.},

	Abstract = {A novel, five-term relational reasoning paradigm was employed during functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural correlates of the symbolic distance effect (SDE). Prior to scanning, participants learned a series of more-than (E{$>$}D{$>$}C{$>$}B{$>$}A) or less-than (AA) and nonadjacent one-step (AA, D{$>$}B and E{$>$}C) and two-step (AA and E{$>$}B) combinatorial entailed tasks. In terms of brain activation, the SDE was identified in the inferior frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral parietal cortex with a graded activation pattern from adjacent to one-step and two-step relations. We suggest that this captures the behavioural SDE of increased accuracy and decreased reaction time from adjacent to two-step relations. One-step relations involving endpoints A or E resulted in greater parietal activation compared to one-step relations without endpoints. Novel contrasts found enhanced activation in right parietal and prefrontal cortices during mutually entailed tasks only for participants who had learned all less-than relations. Increased parietal activation was found for one-step tasks that were inconsistent with prior training. Overall, the findings demonstrate a crucial role for parietal cortex during relational reasoning with a spatially ordered array.},

	Abstract = {If A {$>$} B, and B {$>$} C, it follows logically that A {$>$} C. The process of reaching that conclusion is called transitive inference (TI). Several mechanisms have been offered to explain transitive performance. Scanning models claim that the list is scanned from the ends of the list inward until a match is found. Positional discrimination models claim that positional uncertainty accounts for accuracy and reaction time patterns. In Experiment 1, we trained rhesus monkeys and humans on adjacent pairs (e.g. AB, BC, CD, DE, EF) and tested them with previously untrained nonadjacent pairs (e.g. BD). In Experiment 2, we trained a second list, and tested with nonadjacent pairs selected between lists (e.g. B from list 1, D from list 2). We then introduced associative competition between adjacent items in Experiment 3 by training two items per position (e.g. B1C1, B2C2) before testing with untrained nonadjacent items. In all three Experiments, humans and monkeys showed distance effects in which accuracy increased, and reaction time decreased, as the distance between items in each pair increased (e.g. BD vs. BE). In Experiment 4, we trained adjacent pairs with separate 9- list and 5-item lists. We then tested with nonadjacent pairs selected between lists to determine whether list items were chosen according to their absolute position (e.g. D, 5-item list {$>$} E, 9-item list), or their relative position (e.g. D, 5-item list {$<$} E, 9-item list). Both monkeys' and humans' choices were most consistent with a relative positional organization.},

	Abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) exhibit intact rote learning with impaired generalization. A transitive inference paradigm, involving training on four sequentially presented stimulus pairs containing overlapping items, with subsequent testing on two novel pairs, was used to investigate this pattern of learning in 27 young adults with ASDs and 31 matched neurotypical individuals (TYPs). On the basis of findings about memory and neuropathology, we hypothesized that individuals with ASDs would use a relational flexibility/conjunctive strategy reliant on an intact hippocampus, versus an associative strength/value transfer strategy requiring intact interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. Hypotheses were largely confirmed. ASDs demonstrated reduced interference from intervening pairs in early training; only TYPs formed a serial position curve by test; and ASDs exhibited impairments on the novel test pair consisting of end items with intact performance on the inner test pair. However, comparable serial position curves formed for both groups by the end of the first block.},

	Abstract = {This investigation assessed prospective bases of non-human primate cognitive operations that support serial list memory. Four macaques learned 3-, 5-item ordered lists of objects (as two-choice problems) and then either did or did not (in a within-subject design) receive training on pairs that linked the three original lists into a 15-item serial order. Next, subjects experienced selective exposure trials on object pairs that either maintained or contrasted to the serial position relationships seen during original learning. Subsequent comprehensive tests assessed the interactive effects of linking and exposure conditions on choosing in accord with a combined 15-item serial order. Linking readily induced monkeys to merge lists into a 15-item order, but restricting early exposure to pairs with the same positional relationships as original training slowed, but did not prevent, list combination. Exposure to positional relationships congruent with the combined (15-item) list and different from those of original 5-item training aided both expression of the linking effect and acquisition after no link training. Thus, list linking facilitated serial reorganization by inducing release from error derived from memory for prior learned positional relationships. The task was recommended as a prospective evaluator of continuity of cognitive processes among species.},

	Abstract = {Following training with verbal stimulus relations involving A is greater than B and B is greater than C, verbally-competent individuals reliably select A{$>$}C when asked ``which is greater, A or C?'' (i.e., verbal transitive inference). This result is easy to interpret. Nonhuman animals and humans with and without intellectual disabilities have been exposed to nonverbal transitive-inference procedures involving trained arbitrary stimulus relations. Following the training of A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, and D+E-, B reliably is selected over D (i.e., nonverbal transitive inference). Such findings are more challenging to interpret. The present research explored accounts of nonverbal transitive inference based in transitive inference per se, reinforcement, such as value-transfer theory, and operant stimulus control. In Experiment 1, college students selected B{$>$}G following the training of A+B-, B+C-, C+D-///E+F-, F+G-, and G+H- (where///signifies the omission of D+E-). In Experiment 2, college students selected B{$>$}G following the training of A+B-, B+C-, C+D-///E+F-, F+G-, and G+X- (where X refers to 10 stimuli that alternated across trials). In Experiment 3, college students selected G{$>$}B following the training of Y+B-, B+C-, C+D-///E+F-, F+G-, and G+X- (where Y and X refer to 10 stimuli, respectively, that alternated across trials). These findings are discussed in the context of operant stimulus control by offering an approach based in stimulus B typically acquiring only a select stimulus control topography.},

	Abstract = {The logical and behavioural properties of stimulus equivalence (SE) sets and serial learning (SL) sets are different, yet either can be derived from a randomly presented number of overlapping premise pairs, and both show transitive inference (TI). A within-participant experiment is reported which attempted to base both types of set on the same stimuli. To provide an `ecologically valid' context the stimuli were photographs of 2 imaginary groups of 7 students ordered within each group by `exam grades'. Participants were given respondent-type training in `study phases' in which the 12 premise pairs of photos were randomly presented without a response being required, alternating with `response phases' in which the 10 participants in the `SE first' group received matching-to-sample trials and the 10 in the `SL first' group received trials with the study pairs of stimuli, in which they had to indicate whether these were in the same order as in the study phase or had been switched around. TI testing was then first conducted using the same requirement as in training, followed by similar tests using the other kind of response requirement. In a parallel sorting test participants were shown the 14 photos in random array on a screen and were asked to arrange them into 2 ordered groups. This sorting test was given 3 times, (1) after initial training on either SE or SL; (2) after TI testing with the same paradigm; (3) after TI testing with the opposite paradigm. Though the yield of accurate responding on the TI tests was poor, performance on initial TI testing was both more accurate and showed greater positive transfer to the other kind of TI test when SL preceded SE than vice versa. Results on the sorting task gave stronger indications of set formation than the TI tests, particularly in the SL first group. There were signs of the predicted increase in accuracy and decrease in RT as a function of increasing numbers of nodes in SL in the SL-first group, and some sign of the predicted inverse relation between accuracy and nodal number in SE for the SE-first group. When the groups switched to the opposite types of test to that on which they had been trained both showed an overall reduction in RTs and both showed decreasing RTs with increasing numbers of nodes. Unsurprisingly the experiment raised more questions than it could answer but suggested ways in which the similarities and differences between SL and SE, and how they interact, may be further explored.},

We examined 9-month-old infants' inferences about third-party affiliation based on shared and opposing evaluations. Infants expected two people who expressed shared evaluations to interact positively, whereas they expected two people who expressed opposing evaluations to interact negatively. A control condition revealed that infants' expectations could not be due to mere perceptual repetition. Thus, an abstract understanding that third-party affiliation can be based on shared intentions has roots in the first year of life.

After assuring that the first 3 lists were well retained, the researchers attempted to link these by training only the 2 end-item pairs that ordered all 45 items into an inclusive series. A 20-day test of possible pairings among these 45 items was then conducted. Subsequently, the other 3 lists were trained and tested for retention, but no link training was provided. Then, a test like the one that had followed linking was administered. Unlike previous outcomes with three 5-item lists, linking did not yield immediate merger of three 15-item lists into a 45-item list, although 45-item lists were acquired after sufficient exposure to the testing/training regimen under both linking and nonlinking conditions. List length as a limiting factor in linking suggested processing restrictions analogous to those observed in human list memory.

Relational knowledge is dynamic and flexible, entails structure-consistent mappings between representations, has properties of compositionality and systematicity, and depends on binding in working memory. We review three types of computational models relevant to relational knowledge. The first are formal models of structural commonalities among concepts, including some that differ in surface characteristics. The second is a self-modifying production system model of the role of relational knowledge in strategy acquisition. The third comprises symbolic connectionist models that implement key properties of relational cognition. These models are complemented by the semantic cognition model that shows how some developmentally important concept acquisition mechanisms can emerge from learning input\textendash{}output functions. We conclude that no one type of model fully suffices as an account of cognitive development but there is potential for future development, including hybrid models that could meet most or all of the criteria.},

Experiment 1, necessary to support methodology used in subsequent experiments, demonstrated that infants can track the goals of others in a visual habituation paradigm even when a goal object changes position. Experiment 2 examined the capacity of infants to make context-dependant judgments regarding an actor's two goal-directed actions (i.e., that object A would be grasped when paired with B, and B would be grasped when paired with C). Experiment 3 examined whether infants encode these contextually contingent goals in a linear order (e.g., A {$>$} B {$>$} C). Infants are able to use contextual information to correctly encode the actions of others, yet no evidence was found for encoding this information in a linear order.},

	Abstract = {Whether spatial learning is a special case of
configural or relational learning, or whether
abstract principles evolved from the concrete
need to navigate in space, is a question of long-
standing debate. The parallel map theory of
hippocampal function offers a resolution of the
debate by redefining 'spatial learning' as two
parallel, geometric processes, Euclidean metric
and topological. Moreover, these processes are
subserved by independent hippocampal sub-
fields that underlie two ways of representing
space, the bearing and the sketch map. It is
possible that configural and relational learning,
like spatial learning, should also be distinguish-
ed in this way. Transitive inference, requiring
the construction of a value gradient, could be
analyzed as a Euclidean metric problem. In
contrast, transverse patterning could be seen as
a topological analysis of the relationships among
discrete objects. If this interpretation is correct,
lesions to the primary bearing map structure
(dentate gyrus) should impair transitivify while
lesions to the primary sketch map structure
(CAl) should impair transverse patterning and
similar topological tasks. Recent results from
diverse species and tasks lend support to these
predictions, suggesting that the hippocampus
not only creates parallel maps but uses these
maps to solve more abstract configural or
relational problems.},

The results indicate that C. apella is competent to classify nine items concurrently, first into three disjoint classes where class exemplars are identical to one another, then into three reciprocal classes which share common exemplar (size) features. In the final phase we compare the relative efficiency of executive control under conditions where both hierarchical and/or linear organization can be utilized. Whilst this shows a superiority of categorical based size seriation for a nine item test set suggesting an adaptive advantage for hierarchical over linear organization, Cebus nevertheless achieved high levels of principled linear size seriation with sequence lengths not normally achieved by children below the age of six years.},

I propose, however, that carefully fashioned cognitive theories that make predictions that are inconsistent with current behavioral theories can provide useful research tools for the understanding of behavior. Furthermore, even if the results of such research may be accommodated by modifying existing behavioral theories, our understanding of behavior is often advanced by the empirical findings because it is unlikely that the research would have been conducted in the absence of such cognitive hypothesizing. Two examples of the development of emergent relations are described: The first deals with the nature of a pigeon's `representation' of two stimuli both of which are associated with correct responding to a third in a many-to-one matching task (stimulus equivalence or common representations). The second has to do with transitive inference, the emergent relation between two stimuli mediated by their relation to a common stimulus in a simultaneous discrimination.},

	Abstract = {One implication of such quotations is that understanding complex issues is enhanced by preliminary knowledge of simpler component processes. In the present instance, research on memory organisation in animals is encouraged as a tactic to allow insights into integrative operations underlying cognitive processes in other species. It should be noted that here the appeal to simplicity derives, not from reductionist rationale, but from the prospect that animal research provides advantages in experimental control and precision of measurement. In his comparative treatments, Charles Darwin (1859, 1988) used the terms `organs' and `instincts' when referring to anatomy and behaviour, respectively. He stated that: `I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable. It is thus, that I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated.' Accordingly, it seems just as appropriate to seek animal analogues of complex behaviours as to study the evolution of morphology.},

However, most of the research on models of TI has relied on data from pigeons. Pigeons are trained sequentially (first A+ B-, then B+ C-, etc.); the number of stimuli is limited to 5; and correction trials are used during training. In contrast, primates can be trained with 7 stimuli (A to G) introduced simultaneously with no correction trials. Would the models still accurately account for these data? We will present the results of simulations with two configural models of TI (Wynne, 1995; Siemann \& Delius, 1998) used to predict transitive choices of rhesus monkeys after successive and simultaneous training in 7-item series task, as well as after a list-linking procedure. Our results suggest that reinforcement-based models do not account for symbolic distance effect after backward training (first F+ G-, then E+ F-, and so on). Surprisingly, the models provide a relatively good fit of list linking data, contrary to common belief that list-linking design presents a challenge for such models.},

Using a paradigm where participants first learn a series of four overlapping pairs that constitute the ordered sequence A{$>$}B{$>$}C{$>$}D{$>$}E and are then tested on the novel TI pair BD and non-TI pair AE, animal experiments demonstrated that intact function of the hippocampus is necessary for TI but not for non-TI. We performed three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to identify neural correlates of TI in healthy humans. First, we show hippocampal activation in learning overlapping pairs that constitute an ordered sequence but not non-overlapping individual pairs. Second, we demonstrate hippocampal recruitment in inferences on the ordered sequence of overlapping pairs (TI) but not on non-overlapping pairs (non-TI, e.g., if a{$>$}b and c{$>$}d then a{$>$}d). We then demonstrate the specificity of hippocampal activation to TI on pairs that are devoid of sequence end-items (e.g., B{$>$}D vs. A{$>$}C). The results support the relational flexibility account of hippocampal function.},

	Abstract = {Many recent discoveries in animal cognition have shown that species once thought to be relatively simple are in fact capable of complex problem-solving in accordance with their ecological needs. These findings have resulted from experiments designed with the evolutionary history of the focal species in mind. Transitive inference (TI), the abiliy to infer the ordering of non-adjacent objects within a series, is a cognitive skill once thought to be exclusive to humans. Now considered a litmus-test for logical-relational reasoning, TI is thought to have evolved in social species in order to help track dominance relationships. Although recent work has shown that animals can display TI, it has yet to be demonstrated in the natural context in which it evolved. Songbirds may use TI to gain relative dominance information about others during countersinging interactions, through their use of network communication. Here I demonstrate tha  t black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) use TI to judge the relative rank of unknown territorial intruders during the breeding season using dominance information provided through song contests. Using a multispeaker playback, I provided focal males with the relative ranks of three simulated ``males'' through two countersinging interactions (A {$>$} B, B {$>$} C).  I predicted that when presented with the non-adjacent pair (A and C) with no relative rank information provided, focal males would choose to defend against the intruder they perceived as the greater threat. Consistent with my predictions, t he majority of focal males approached ``male'' A. Additionally, male responses were influenced by age, with older males (in their second or later breeding season) approaching the dominant intruder more consistently than younger males (in their first breeding season). This is the first instance of TI being demonstrated in a natural population of untrained animals, and has iii important implications for the understanding of songbird communication networks. Transitive inference may be used in several natural situations by chickadees throughout the breeding season and a number of possible avenues for future TI research are discussed. Additionally, methods are suggested for the examination of TI during the non-breeding season.},

	Abstract = {Recent research suggests that dopamine facilitates the formation of long term memory and may allow for the adaptive use of memory. During reinforcement learning, dopamine is released in the ventral tegmental area of the brain (VTA), which facilitates long term potentiation (LTP). The VTA is also reactivated during sleep, although the function of this reactivation is currently unknown. Additionally, there is evidence that sleep also facilitates the generalization of memory; however an interaction between the dopaminergic system and sleep on the adaptive use of memory has not been directly investigated. Thus, in this study we investigated the combined effects of the interaction between sleep and reinforcement during learning on performance in a transitive inference task, which requires the integration and generalization of disparate premise memories. Our results showed that: 1) reinforcement during learning is required for successful generalization in transitive inference; 2) when reinforcement occurs during learning, sleep further enhances the ability to make transitive inferences, compared to an equal period of wake. These data provide evidence of an interaction between sleep and the dopamine reward system to facilitate generalization from existing memories.},

In two experiments, we find that preschoolers use statistical information about an agent's choices to infer the graded strengths of preferences. From observing an agent's choices, preschoolers inferred that objects the agent chose less consistently were less preferred than objects the agent chose more consistently.

	Abstract = {Human and animals are able to decide that A{$>$}C after having learnt that A{$>$}B and B{$>$}C. This basic property of logical thinking has been studied by transitive inference (TI) tasks. It has been hypothesized that subjects displace the premises of the inference on a mental line to solve the task. An evidence in favor of this interpretation is the observation of the symbolic distance effect, that is the improvement of the performance as the distance between items increases. This effect has been interpreted as support to the hypothesis that ability to perform TI tasks follows the same rules and is mediated by the same brain circuits involved in the performance of spatial tasks. We tested ten subjects performing a TI on an ordered list of Japanese characters while they were fixating either leftwards or rightwards, to evaluate whether the eye position modulated the performance in making TI as it does in spatial tasks. Our results show a significant linear decrease of the reaction time with the increase of the symbolic distance and a shift of this trend towards lower reaction times when subjects were fixating to the left. We interpret this eye position effect as a further evidence that spatial and reasoning tasks share the same underlying mechanisms and neural substrates. The eye position effect also points to a parietal cortex involvement in the neural circuit involved in transitive reasoning.},

Both types of reasoning were characterized by activation of left lateral prefrontal and bilateral dorsal frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Neural responses unique to each type of reasoning determined from the Reasoning Type (deduction and induction) by Task (reasoning and baseline) interaction indicated greater involvement of left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44) in deduction than induction, while left dorsolateral (BA 8/9) prefrontal gyrus showed greater activity during induction than deduction.

	Abstract = {The ability of an experimentally experienced female California sea lion to form transitive relations across sensory modalities was tested using a matching-to-sample procedure. The subject was trained by trial-and-error, using differential reinforcement, to relate an acoustic sample stimulus to one member from each of two previously established visual classes. Once the two auditory\textendash{}visual relations were formed, she was tested to determine whether untrained transitive relations would emerge between each of the acoustic stimuli and the remaining stimuli of each 10-member visual class. During testing, the sea lion demonstrated immediate transfer by responding correctly on 89 \% of the 18 novel transfer trials compared to 88 \% on familiar baseline trials. We then repeated this training and transfer procedure twice more with new auditory\textendash{}visual pairings with similar positive results. Finally, the six explicitly trained auditory\textendash{}visual relations and the 56 derived auditory\textendash{}visual relations were intermixed in a single session, and the subject's performance remained stable at high levels. This sea lion's transfer performance indicates that a nonhuman animal is capable of forming new associations through cross-modal transitivity.},

	Abstract = {Ordinal understanding is involved in understanding social hierarchies, series of actions, and everyday events. Moreover, an appreciation of numerical order is critical to understanding to number at a highly abstract, conceptual level. In this paper, we review the findings concerning the development and expression of ordinal numerical knowledge in preverbal human infants in light of literature about the same cognitive abilities in nonhuman animals. We attempt to reconcile seemingly contradictory evidence, provide new directions for prospective research, and evaluate the shared basis of ordinal knowledge among nonverbal organisms. Our review of the research leads us to conclude that both infants and nonhuman animals are adapted to respond to monotonic progressions in numerical order, consonant with mathematical definitions of numerical order. Further, we suggest that patterns in the way that infants and nonhuman animals process numerical order can be accounted for by changes across development, the conditions under which representations are generated, or both.},

For example, the ornithological textbook of choice from the 1960s states the following view of avian intelligence: Flight has proven to be an enormously successful evolutionary venture, but one that has cost birds dearly in mental development. In effect, flight has become a substitute for cleverness; birds solve many potential problems merely by flying away from them\ldots. As a consequence, much [avian] behavior is, by mam-malian standards, fragmentary, stereotyped, and at times amazingly stupid. (Welty, 1962, p.159).},

	Abstract = {In implicit learning, human subjects are exposed to patterned information, but they are not informed about the pattern. Typically, they demonstrate learning of that pattern, but little awareness of the experimental contingencies. In a nonhuman analog of this procedure, two cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) were presented with a five-element chain that consisted of the same icon presented serially at different locations on a touchscreen. The tamarins had to touch the icon at each location to advance the chain and receive reinforcement at the end of the chain. One element of the chain was never differentially reinforced in the presence of another element, as is typically done in transitive inference and serial chaining studies. Following training, the tamarins were tested for their knowledge of the chain using pairwise tests that are common in transitive inference and serial chaining experiments, and a random test, common in some types of implicit learning, in which the sequence of elements was randomized. The results of both tests revealed that the tamarins appreciated the ordinal position of the elements composing the chain, although reinforcement had not been dependent on that knowledge.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the functional\textendash{}anatomical correlates of cognition supporting untrained, emergent relational inference in a stimulus equivalence task. In Experiment 1, after learning a series of conditional relations involving words and pseudowords, participants performed a relatedness task during which EEG was recorded. Behavioural performance was faster and more accurate on untrained, indirectly related symmetry (i.e., learn AB and infer BA) and equivalence trials (i.e., learn AB and AC and infer CB) than on unrelated trials, regardless of whether or not a formal test for stimulus equivalence relations had been conducted. Consistent with previous results, event related potentials (ERPs) evoked by trained and emergent trials at parietal and occipital sites differed only for those participants who had not received a prior equivalence test. Experiment 2 further replicated and extended these behavioural and ERP findings using arbitrary symbols as stimuli and demonstrated time and frequency differences for trained and untrained relatedness trials. Overall, the findings demonstrate convincingly the ERP correlates of intra-experimentally established stimulus equivalence relations consisting entirely of arbitrary symbols and offer support for a contemporary cognitive-behavioural model of symbolic categorisation and relational inference.},

	Abstract = {Over the last quarter century, the dominant tendency in comparative cognitive psychology has been to emphasize the similarities between human and nonhuman minds and to downplay the differences as ``one of degree and not of kind'' (Darwin 1871). In the present target article, we argue that Darwin was mistaken: the profound biological continuity between human and nonhuman animals masks an equally profound discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. To wit, there is a significant discontinuity in the degree to which human and nonhuman animals are able to approximate the higher-order, systematic, relational capabilities of a physical symbol system (PSS) (Newell 1980). We show that this symbolic-relational discontinuity pervades nearly every domain of cognition and runs much deeper than even the spectacular scaffolding provided by language or culture alone can explain. We propose a representational-level specification as to where human and nonhuman animals' abilities to approximate a PSS are similar and where they differ. We conclude by suggesting that recent symbolicconnectionist models of cognition shed new light on the mechanisms that underlie the gap between human and nonhuman minds.},

	Abstract = {Across three experiments, the transformation of consequential functions in accordance with a sevenmember relational network (A\textendash{}B\textendash{}C\textendash{}D\textendash{}E\textendash{}F\textendash{}G) was investigated. In this network, the relational rankings ranged from A, ranked the least, to G, ranked the most. In the first phase, contextual cues for more-than and less-than were established by training participants across multiple exemplars to select comparisons containing larger quantities in the presence of the former cue, and fewer quantities in the presence of the latter cue. Participants then were trained in six conditional discriminations (i.e., A,B, B,C, C,D, E.D, F.E, and G.F) with the contextual cues as samples and nonsense words as comparisons, and all possible derived relations were tested (e.g., B,F). In a subsequent phase, the D stimulus was paired with the delivery of points. Next, a test for a transformation of consequential functions was presented in either simultaneous discrimination tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) or a free-operant schedule task (Experiment 3), each of which employed members of the relational network as consequences. In all experiments, participants consistently emitted the response that produced the derived consequential stimulus that was ranked higher in the relational network, thus demonstrating a transformation of consequential functions. In Experiment 2, the baseline conditional discriminations were altered in a reversal design, and Experiment 3 examined generalization of the derived performance to a schedulebased task, with and without detailed instructions. Overall, the study demonstrated a transformation and generalization of consequential functions in accordance with the relational frames of More-than and Less-than, and bears relevance to the literature on transitive inference.},

Additionally, this study compared the learning processes between chimpanzees and children. Seven chimpanzees were tested using a computer-controlled task. They were trained to choose the stronger of two options according to the game rules. The chimpanzees first engaged in the paper\textendash{}rock sessions until they reached the learning criterion. Subsequently, they engaged in the rock\textendash{}scissors and scissors\textendash{}paper sessions, before progressing to sessions with all three pairs mixed. Five of the seven chimpanzees completed training after a mean of 307 sessions, which indicates that they learned the circular pattern. The chimpanzees required more scissors\textendash{}paper sessions (14.29 {$\pm$} 6.89), the third learnt pair, than paper\textendash{}rock (1.71 {$\pm$} 0.18) and rock\textendash{}scissors (3.14 {$\pm$} 0.70) sessions, suggesting they had difficulty finalizing the circularity. The chimpanzees then received generalization tests using new stimuli, which they learned quickly. A similar procedure was performed with children (35\textendash{}71 months, n = 38) who needed the same number of trials for all three pairs during single-paired sessions. Their accuracy during the mixed-pair sessions improved with age and was better than chance from 50 months of age, which indicates that the ability to solve the transverse patterning problem might develop at around 4 years of age. The present findings show that chimpanzees were able to learn the task but had difficulties with circularity, whereas children learned the task more easily and developed the relevant ability at approximately 4 years of age. Furthermore, the chimpanzees' performance during the mixed-pair sessions was similar to that of 4-year-old children during the corresponding stage of training.},

	Abstract = {A recent report by Amd et al. (2017) demonstrated that orienting towards successively presented stimulusstimulus pairs yielded significantly more transitive relations then when those same pairs were differentially reinforced following training for three, 3-member stimulus sets. We build on that work in four important ways. First, transitivity yields produced by Pavlovian and instrumental procedures were compared following training for three 5-member sets (A1-B1-C1-D1-E1, A2-B2-C2-D2-E2, A3-B3-C3-D3-E3), where the `A' stimuli were emotional faces and all remaining stimuli were nonsense words. Second, our instrumental task here required two orienting/observing responses per trial. Third, we compared differences in multi-nodal transfer following Pavlovian and instrumental relational learning procedures. Finally, we tested whether functioning as `end terms' in a relational series can mitigate transfer following instrumental conditioning. Transitivity, as measured by sorting tests, was significantly more pronounced following Pavlovian training. Transfer, assessed before and after relational training with two visual analog scales corresponding to valence and arousal dimensions, appeared marginally more robust observed for participants exposed to the Pavlovian condition. Transfer magnitude was positively related with demonstrations of transitivity, regardless of type of conditioning.},

	Abstract = {The standard methodology of comparative psychology has long relied upon a distinction between
cognition and `mere association'; cognitive explanations of nonhuman animals behaviors are only
regarded as legitimate if associative explanations for these behaviors have been painstakingly ruled
out. Over the last ten years, however, a crisis has broken out over the distinction, with researchers
increasingly unsure how to apply it in practice. In particular, a recent generation of psychological
models appear to satisfy existing criteria for both cognition and association. Salvaging the standard
methodology of comparative psychology will thus require significant conceptual redeployment.
In this article, I trace the historical development of the distinction in comparative psychology,
distinguishing two styles of approach. The first style tries to make out the distinction in terms of the
properties of psychological models, for example by focusing on criteria like the presence of rules \&
propositions vs. links \& nodes. The second style of approach attempts to operationalize the
distinction by use of specific experimental tests for cognition performed on actual animals. I argue
that neither style of criteria is self-sufficient, and both must cooperate in an iterative empirical
investigation into the nature of animal minds if the distinction is to be reformed.},

	Abstract = {There is considerable interest in the conditions under which human subjects learn patterned information without explicit instructions to learn that information. This form of learning, termed implicit or incidental learning, can be approximated in nonhumans by exposing subjects to patterned information but delivering reinforcement randomly, thereby not requiring the subjects to learn the information in order to be reinforced. Following acquisition, nonhuman subjects are queried as to what they have learned about the patterned information. In the present experiment, we extended the study of implicit learning in nonhumans by comparing two species, cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) and pigeons (Columba livia), on an implicit learning task that used an artificial grammar to generate the patterned elements for training. We equated the conditions of training and testing as much as possible between the two species. The results indicated that both species demonstrated approximately the same magnitude of implicit learning, judged both by a random test and by choice tests between pairs of training elements. This finding suggests that the ability to extract patterned information from situations in which such learning is not demanded is of longstanding origin.},

	Abstract = {Whether any non-human animal can attribute mental states to othersremains the subject of extensive debate. This despite the fact that several specieshave behaved as if they have a `theory of mind' in various behavioral tasks. In thispaper, we review the reasons of skeptics for their doubts: That existing experimentalsetups cannot distinguish between `mind readers' and `behavior readers', that resultsthat seem to indicate `theory of mind' may come from studies that are insufficientlycontrolled, and that our own intuitive biases may lead us to interpret behavior more`cognitively' than is necessary. The merits of each claim and suggested solution areweighed. The conclusion is that while it istruethat existing setups cannot conclu-sively demonstrate `theory of mind' in non-human animals, focusing on this fact isunlikely to be productive. Instead, the more interesting question is howsophisticatedtheir social reasoning can be, whether it is about `unobservable inner experiences' ornot. Therefore, it is important to address concerns about the setup and interpretationof specific experiments. To alleviate the impact of intuitive biases, various strategieshave been proposed in the literature. These include a deeper understanding of associa-tive learning, a better knowledge of the limited `theory of mind' humans actually use,and thinking of animal cognition in an embodied, embedded way; that is, being awarethat constraintsoutsideof the brain, andoutsideof the body, may naturally predisposeindividuals to produce behavior that looks smart without requiring complex cogni-tion. To enable this kind of thinking, a powerful methodological tool is advocated:Computational modeling, namely agent-based modeling and, particularly, cognitivemodeling. By explicitly simulating the rules and representations that underlie animal performance on specific tasks, it becomes much easier to look past one's own biasesand to see what cognitive processes might actually be occurring},

	Abstract = {The research addressed the role of relational processing capacity in cognitive aging focusing on (a) age-differences in complex relational processing, (b) the domain-generality of complex relational processing, and (c) associations of complex relational processing with other processes. Participants were 125 adults in three groups with mean ages of 30.55 (younger), 53.43 (middle), and 74.41 years (older). Each relational processing task (sentence comprehension, n-term premise integration, Latin square) included items at three complexity levels. Accuracy was lower on more complex items and relational complexity had a greater effect in the older group. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed a single complex relational processing factor, consistent with a domain-general capacity. Relational processing was related to other executive processes. This relationship was stronger in the older than younger and middle groups, possibly reflecting dedifferentiation or neural noise. In structural models with planning (Tower of London) and class reasoning as outcome variables, complex relational processing had a significant impact ({$\beta$} = .455, p {$<$} .001 and {$\beta$} = .661, p {$<$} .001, respectively) over and above age, processing speed, working memory, task switching, response inhibition, and Stroop interference. In the structural model with fluid intelligence (matrix reasoning) as the outcome variable, age had a significant impact ({$\beta$} = -.222, p {$<$} .001), over and above all other variables, suggesting that the processes underpinning age-related declines in matrix reasoning are more diverse than those assessed in the current research. Complex relational processing is an important factor in cognitive aging, possibly reflecting its reliance on prefrontal brain regions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {2 dual-task paradigms, the memory load interference paradigm and the easy-to-hard paradigm, were used as converging operations to study capacity limitations in children's reasoning. The primary task was N-term series reasoning and the secondary task was short-term retention and rehearsal of items. Pilot experiments showed that passive retention of a short-term memory load did not interfere with reasoning. Interference was observed from active rehearsal of large memory loads in Experiment 1, but the results also suggested that interference is probably a function of amount of processing in the secondary task and is not exclusive to mnemonic secondary tasks. The performance of 5-6-year-olds on transitive inference was significantly reduced by a concurrent information-processing task, suggesting a capacity limitation. In Experiment 2, the easy-to-hard paradigm was used and showed that transitive inference scores were predicted by performances on an easier version of the N-term series task performed concurrently with a short-term rehearsal task, when separate performances on the latter 2 were partialed out. It was concluded that transitive inference ability in children is capacity limited.},

@article{halford1987,
	Abstract = {Several contemporary theories of cognitive development appear to agree that children progress through a hierarchy of increasingly powerful cognitive organizations, and that higher-level organizations impose greater information-processing loads. Although theories differ in their method of defining both the levels and the information-processing loads they impose, it is possible to find considerable common ground. In this paper it is argued that the different levels of cognitive organization can be attributed to a hierarchy of structure-mapping rules. Structure mapping is part of the process by which children represent and understand concepts. Four levels of structure mapping are defined. The levels, from lowest to highest, are based on element mappings, relational mappings, system mappings and multiple-system mappings. The higher-level rules are more `abstract' in the sense of being less dependent on specific properties of each task, and are more transferable. However, they also impose higher information-processing demands. Children who lack the information-processing capacity for a particular level of structure mapping will be able to attain concepts that belong to that level. The theory is used to predict the characteristic age of attainment of cognitive tasks including transitivity, classification, interpretation of algebraic expressions, analogies, logical reasoning, and hypothesis testing. It is argued that the four-structure mapping levels can subsume the four main stages of cognitive development.},

	Abstract = {Contrary to earlier work, recent studies have demonstrated a reduction in eye movements during the solution of tasks that seem to require visual imagery, relative to verbal tasks. The present study provides evidence that the nature of the visual imagery required by a task determines whether saccades are evoked and in which spatial pattern. In two experiments, subjects solved transitive inference problems with the relational terms left/right and above/ below, while the horizontal and vertical EOG were recorded. Subjects made more horizontal and fewer vertical saccades while solving problems with the left/right terms than while solving identical problems with above/below. The results of silent counting tasks showed that the rate of subvocalization can also influence saccadic rate, especially in the horizontal plane, but cannot explain the eye-movement patterns observed during transitive inference. The results are discussed in terms of a motor theory of voluntary thinking. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This chapter discusses the construction of preferred mental models in reasoning with interval relations. The interval relations are commonly used as a representational device within artificial intelligence (AI) research on spatial reasoning. From a psychological point of view, they are interesting because they constitute a complete set of spatial relations. AI research on temporal and spatial reasoning has come up with a variety of representational formalisms each of which allows the expression of some specific set of relations holding between temporal or spatial entities. The algorithmic cost of inferences involving such relations can be characterized in terms of computational complexity. Schlieder developed a computational theory of preferred mental models in reasoning by using the data that came from an experiment on spatial three-term series, in which subjects had to produce solutions to all inference problems that can be built from the computation of two interval relations. The chapter describes the experiment on three-interval series. The experiments on spatial three-term series are based on two or four relations. A larger system of relations allows the construction of more three-term series and provides a richer set of data against which to test theoretical predictions.},

The model provides for a relationship between symbolic processes and the problem which depends on structural isomorphism and consistency, but is independent of similarity between symbol elements and problem elements. It is then shown that several different levels of thought can be distinguished within the basic model. More information is needed to assign symbolic processes to a problem in a consistent way with higher-level thought processes than with lower-level processes. These information-processing requirements permit the approximate age of mastery of each level to be predicted, thereby offering an alternate theory of cognitive developmental stages.

	Abstract = {It is proposed that much human inference is basically analogi\- cal, and the implications of this theory for cognitive develop\- ment are examined. Analogy entails mapping the problem representation (target) into a structurally similar schema (base). which has been leamed through experience. It can help explain some significant reasoning phenomena, such as errors in the four-card problem. The theory is explicated by analys\- ing tbe processes entailed in transitive inference and class inclusion tasks. Two sources of difficulty that arise in analogi\- cal reasoning are (a) mapping problems to inappropriate sche\- mas, and (b) processing loads imposed by mappings. The loads are greater for more complex concepts. A conceptual complexity metric is defined, which distinguishes four levels of structure mapping. The levels increase in flexibility and abstractness, but at the price of increased processing load. Tbe relation of the model to contemporary accounts of reasoning is examined. and it is shown to be consistent witb the theory of pragmatic reasoning schemas, and other knowledge-depen\- dent approaches. while maintaining an important role for structure. lmplications of the theory for the stage debate and other issues in cognitive development are considered.},

	Abstract = {Research on qualitative spatial reasoning has produced an impressive number of systems of relations for representing topological, ordinal and metrical information. In comparison, the number of reasoning procedures that has been proposed is rather limited. Most approaches simply rely on standard constraint propagation techniques such as the path consistency algorithm. Evidence from cognitive science indicates that human reasoners solve spatial relational inferences not by constraint satisfaction methods but by constructing and inspecting mental models in visuo-spatial working memory. From a computational point of view, this strategy combines the relational representations used in qualitative spatial reasoning with the local spatial transformations studied in diagrammatic reasoning. However, applying local transformations to arbitrary relational representations involves solving the intractable subgraph isomorphism problem. The paper describes a class of representations, relational maps, for which the problem becomes tractable and for which, as a consequence, diagrammatic inference is implementable by efficient local transformations.},

	Abstract = {A computer-simulation model of strategy development in N-term series (transitive inference) problems is presented. The model learns strategies for performing N-term series using knowledge that can be acquired through play experiences with sets of objects. It is theorised that declarative knowledge acquired through play with sets of objects is utilized by analogical reasoning mechanisms to guide the development of strategies. Procedural knowledge, also acquired through play, is utilized by means-end analysis. These two types of knowledge are used to build strategies as they are required to solve transitive inference problems. Once developed, strategies are strengthened by associative learning mechanisms. Thus the model blends associative and metacognitive strategy development mechanisms. If strategies appropriate to a task are available they are applied, new strategies being developed as required. The model simulates the transition from no strategies, through primitive strategies in which premises are processed singly, leading to errors, to adequate strategies in which premises are integrated, leading to correct performance. The simulation is a self-modifying production system model, based on PRISM-II.},

	Abstract = {Human spatial relational reasoning has been investigated by presenting participants with premises like: ``The triangle is to the left of the circle, the circle is to the left of the square. Which relation holds between the triangle and the square?'' Participants are expected to interpret the descriptions in a way that corresponds to the logical options that are theoretically available. Recent findings on spatial language usage highlight a range of pragmatic principles that speakers intuitively adhere to when producing and comprehending spatial relationship descriptions; these appear to contradict the principles used in relational reasoning studies. In order to clarify the relation between speakers' intuitions and the descriptions used in relational reasoning tasks, we present two studies in which linguistic representations of relevant configurations were elicited. Results highlight the systematic patterns speakers use in describing these configurations, adding new insights to research on spatial language usage across various levels of analysis. We argue that the identified principles may interfere with the reasoning processes investigated in earlier studies, and suggest that future studies should adequately account for the principles underlying intuitive spatial language use.},

	Abstract = {Fuzzy trace theory posits that during development the use of verbatim information for solving transitive relationships shifts to the use of gist information. In cognitive developmental research that uses a cross-sectional design, the binomial mixture model is often used to identify such shifts. Because the binomial mixture model assumes equal task difficulty and uses the number of correctly solved tasks for data analysis, it may be too restrictive and the more flexible latent class model is adopted as an alternative. This model allows varying task difficulty and uses the pattern of task scores as input for data analysis. The binomial mixture model and the latent class model are compared theoretically, and applied to transitive reasoning test data obtained from a cross-sectional sample of 615 children. The latent class model is found to be more appropriate for identifying multiple phases. Three phases are distinguished which can be interpreted well by means of fuzzy trace theory. These phases do not encompass fixed age periods.},

	Abstract = {The authors present a theoretical framework for understanding the roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in learning and memory. This framework incorporates a theme found in many theories of hippocampal function: that the hippocampus is responsible for developing conjunctive representations binding together stimulus elements into a unitary representation that can later be recalled from partial input cues. This idea is contradicted by the fact that hippocampally lesioned rats can learn nonlinear discrimination problems that require conjunctive representations. The authors' framework accommodates this finding by establishing a principled division of labor, where the cortex is responsible for slow learning that integrates over multiple experiences to extract generalities whereas the hippocampus performs rapid learning of the arbitrary contents of individual experiences. This framework suggests that tasks involving rapid, incidental conjunctive learning are better tests of hippocampal function. The authors implement this framework in a computational neural network model and show that it can account for a wide range of data in animal learning.

To test this hypothesis, and to identify the involvement of specific regions within right prefrontal cortex we scanned 17 normal volunteers with fMRI while they engaged in a transitive inference task involving determinate and indeterminate relations. The results show a nice crossover interaction such that, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 47) is selectively activated by the processing of indeterminate trials with no belief-bias cues, while left lateral prefrontal cortex (BA 45) is selectively activated by the processing of indeterminate trials containing belief-bias cues. These results are not only consistent with, but also amplify, the lesion data by identifying specific regions within right and left prefrontal cortex.},

Drawing on a sample of 409 5\textendash{}13-year olds, we demonstrate the advantages of latent variable models in the area of transitive reasoning.

	Abstract = {We propose and test three statistical models for the analysis of children's responses to the balance scale task, a seminal task to study proportional reasoning. We use a latent class modelling approach to formulate a rule-based latent class model (RB LCM) following from a rule-based perspective on proportional reasoning and a new statistical model, the Weighted Sum Model, following from an information-integration approach. Moreover, a hybrid LCM using item covariates is proposed, combining aspects of both a rule-based and information-integration perspective. These models are applied to two different datasets, a standard paper-and-pencil test dataset (N = 779), and a dataset collected within an online learning environment that included direct feedback, time-pressure, and a reward system (N = 808). For the paper-and-pencil dataset the RB LCM resulted in the best fit, whereas for the online dataset the hybrid LCM provided the best fit. The standard paper-and-pencil dataset yielded more evidence for distinct solution rules than the online data set in which quantitative item characteristics are more prominent in determining responses. These results shed new light on the discussion on sequential rule-based and information-integration perspectives of cognitive development.},

	Abstract = {This research aimed to explore the effect of teaching Categories on the emergence of the intraverbals studied by P{\'e}rez-Gonz{\'a}lez, Herszlikowicz, and Williams (The Psychological Record 58;95\textendash{}-129, 2008). Ten 6- and 7-year-old children were recruited and divided into 2 conditions. In Condition 1, 5 children learned intraverbals in which they had to say exemplars of 3 categories (e.g., ``Name a continent''\textemdash{}''Europe'')\textemdash{}the Exemplars. They also learned intraverbals in which they had to say the categories of the exemplars named by the experimenter (e.g., ``What is Europe''\textemdash{}''A continent'')\textemdash{}the Categories. Thereafter, they learned to say the countries corresponding to two cities (the A-B relations) and to say the continents of the two countries (the B-C relations). Finally, the intraverbals that result from combining A, B, and, C stimuli were probed, such as asking the cities corresponding to the continents. Five children in Condition 2 received the same experience, but they did not learn the Categories initially. Four of the 5 children of Condition 1 demonstrated the emergence of all probed ABC intraverbals, but no child of Condition 2 did so initially. These results indicate that learning Categories together with the Exemplars plays a strong role in the emergence of the probed ABC intraverbals. These findings reveals some basic learning processes involved in reasoning processes, such as transitive inference.},

	Abstract = {Smedslund's recent article, reporting an 8-year emergence of transitivity of length and criticizing the writer's finding of an earlier age, is answered on two grounds. First, evidence is reviewed indicating that the task requirements were probably not clear to Smedslund's Ss, and that his data are consistent with an earlier age of emergence. Second, Smedslund's contention that simple generalization processes account for the writer's finding of length transitivity in most 5-year-olds is disputed by a control experiment reported-Smedslund's own data on the point seem irrelevant. Further, it is argued that the kind of experimental procedures advocated by the writer yield better support for Piaget's concept of developmental stage than "classical" Piagetian procedures.},

	Abstract = {In a simple simultaneous discrimination involving a positive stimulus (S+) and a negative
stimulus (S2 ), it has been hypothesized that positive value can transfer from the S+ to the
S2 (thus increasing the relative value of the S2 ) and also that negative value can transfer
from the S2 to the S+ (thus diminishing the relative value of the S+; Fersen, Wynne,
Delius, \& Staddon, 1991). Evidence for positive value transfer has been reported in pigeons
(e.g. Zentall \& Sherburne, 1994). The purpose of the present experiments was to determine,
in a simultaneous discrimination, whether the S2 diminishes the value of the S+ or the S2
is contrasted with the S+ (thus enhancing the value of the S+). In two experiments, we found
evidence for contrast, rather than value transfer, attributable to simultaneous discrimination
training. Thus, not only does the S+ appear to enhance the value of the S2 , but the S2
appears to enhance rather than reduce the value of the S+.},

@article{prado2013a,
	Abstract = {It has long been suggested that transitive reasoning relies on spatial representations in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Previous neuroimaging studies, however, have always focused on linear arguments, such as ``John is taller than Tom, Tom is taller than Chris, therefore John is taller than Chris.'' Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we demonstrate here that verbal representations contribute to transitive reasoning when it involves set-inclusion relations (e.g., ``All Tulips are Flowers, All Flowers are Plants, therefore All Tulips are Plants''). In the present study, such arguments were found to engage verbal processing regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left PPC that were identified in an independent localizer task. Specifically, activity in these verbal regions increased as the number of relations increased in set-inclusion arguments. Importantly, this effect was specific to set-inclusion arguments because left IFG and left PPC were not differentially engaged when the number of relations increased in linear arguments. Instead, such an increase was linked to decreased activity in a spatial processing region of the right PPC that was identified in an independent localizer task. Therefore, both verbal and spatial representations can underlie transitive reasoning, but their engagement depends upon the structure of the argument.},

An analogous list (F through 1) was similarly trained. Subsequently, both lists were linked by training on E\textendash{}F+, a pair that provided adjacent elements from each list. Then, all unique and trained object pairs from both lists were presented as a test. Results indicated that the objects were retained as a single, linearly organized list with choice accuracy directly related to interitem distance between paired objects. A second experiment explored the consequences of incidence of conflicting information on list organization. In both experiments, selections depended on representational processes and supported the view that monkeys and pigeons retain serial lists in qualitatively different ways.

	Abstract = {The emergence of transitive relations between stimuli that had never been directly paired with one another can be examined through a phenomenon called Transitive Inference (TI). The present experiment explored contextually controlled TI effects in verbally able humans. Specifically, participants were trained in the conditional discriminations A1+B1-, B1+C1-, C1+D1-, D1+E1-, E1+F1-, F1+G1- and G1+H1- in the presence of a cue (Cue 1), followed by tests for mutual and combinatorial entailment in the presence of either Cue 1 or Cue 2. Note that Cue 1 and Cue 2 had been previously established as functionally equivalent to happier-than and unhappier-than contexts, respectively. Using a performance-based measure of ``implicit preferences,'' we predicted that successfully demonstrating entailment would yield a performance indicating C1 as more positively valenced than F1. Similarly, if participants learned the discriminations A2+B2-, B2+C2-, C2+D2-, D2+E2-, E2+F2-, F2+G2-, G2+H2- in the presence of Cue 2 only, followed by tests for entailment in the presence of both Cues 1 and 2, we predicted that C2 should be responded to as more negatively valenced than F2. Performances across both conditions supported these predictions, furthering the evidence for the claim that emotional valences can be derived through functionally transitive stimulus-stimulus relations.},

	Abstract = {Human language and our use of it to communicate or to understand the world requires deriving relations among events: for example, if A=B and A=C, then B=C. Relational frame theory argues that such performances are at the heart of any meaningful psychology of language and cognition. From a very early age, human beings learn relations of similarity, difference, comparison, time, and so on, and modify what they do in a given situation based on its derived relation to others situations and what is known about them. This volume goes beyond theory and gives the empirical and conceptual tools to conduct an experimental analysis of virtually every substantive topic in human language and cognition, both basic and applied. As the term `post-Skinnerian' suggests, this volume challenges behavioral psychology to abandon many of the specific theoretical formulations of its most prominent historical leader in the domain of complex human behavior, especially in human language and cognition, and approach the field from a new direction. The need for a pragmatically useful analysis of language and cognition is as enormous and varied as its extensions and applications.

	Abstract = {Human and animal decision-making is known to violate rational expectations in a variety of contexts. Statistical structures of real-world environments may account for such seemingly irrational behavior. In a computerized experiment, 16 capuchins, 7 rhesus monkeys, and 30 humans chose between up to three options of different value. The options disappeared and became available again with different probabilities. Subjects overwhelmingly chose transitively (A{$>$}B, B{$>$}C, and A{$>$}C) in the control condition, where doing so maximized overall gain. However, most subjects also adhered to transitivity in the test condition, where it was suboptimal but led to negligible losses compared to the optimal strategy. Only a few of the capuchins were able to maximize long-term gain by violating transitivity. Adhering to rational choice principles may facilitate the formation of near-optimal decision rules when short- and long-term goals align. Such cognitive shortcuts may have evolved to preserve mental resources.},

	Abstract = {The volume was translated from the French by Marjorie Warden, and the work was done in collaboration with Mlles. Cartalis, Escher, Hanhart, Hahnloser, Matthes, Perret and M. Roud. There are five chapters, of which the last is a summary of the present volume and Language and Thought in the Child (see I: 169) of which it is an extension. By having the children complete sentences containing because and although, and by observing their spontaneous use of these words, it was ascertained that up to 7-8 these relations are not present, being equivalent for the child to and and but. By carefully examining the mental processes concerned with answering simple arithmetic reasoning problems, it appeared that no account could be given of these processes even when correct, and that when pressed the child simply invented some process and believed he had used it. A chapter on How the Child Reasons demonstrates that the child is incapable of generalization because the bases of judgment are as yet only juxtaposed, not arranged in hierarchies; assimilation vs. imitation and the ability to effect logical multiplication are discussed at length. Throughout, two critical points are distinguished, one at 7-8 years, the other at 11-12 years; before the first, the child's thought is so completely egocentric that he cannot place himself outside his own viewpoint, and his logical inadequacies are shown to proceed uniformly and ultimately from this circumstance. The factor which tends to undermine this egocentrism is the growth of socialization, which by the second critical period has progressed to such an extent that logical processes approximating those of the adult are made possible.

@article{waite2001,
	Abstract = {. Decision makers are often assumed to assign stable fitness-based values to foraging options. Under this assumption, the tendency to prefer the more valuable of two simultaneously available options should be transitive. For example, if option a is preferred when paired with b, and b is preferred when paired with c, then a should be preferred when paired with c. According to the principle of strong stochastic transitivity, the preference for a over c should be at least as strong as the stronger of the other two preferences (i.e., p(a,c){$\geq$}max[p(a,b), p(b,c)]). Gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) collecting food for storage violated this principle, and failed to support even weaker forms of transitivity. All subjects preferred option a (one raisin, 28 cm into a tube) over b (two raisins, 42 cm), and b over c (three raisins, 56 cm), but none of the subjects preferred a over c. Such paradoxical preferences are often interpreted as evidence for simple heuristics rather than complex decision mechanisms. According to bounded rationality, intransitive choice is a suboptimal byproduct of heuristics that usually perform well in real-world situations. Alternatively, intransitive choice could be a byproduct of selection favoring a complex decision process involving context-dependent assessment of each the fitness-related value of each option. From this perspective, the decision maker's subjective valuation of each option is not fixed, but rather depends on the context (i.e., the specific pairing of options). In the experiment, the subjective value of option a was apparently lower in option set \{a,c\} than in \{a,b\}. A model of context-dependent choice is used to explore conditions under which adaptive choice based on a complex decision process can lead to intransitivity.},

@article{maclean2008,
	Abstract = {Transitive Inference is a form of deductive reasoning that has been suggested as one cognitive mechanism by which animals could learn the many relationships within their group's dominance hierarchy. This process thus bears relevance to the social intelligence hypothesis which posits evolutionary links between various forms of social and nonsocial cognition. Recent evidence corroborates the link between social complexity and transitive inference and indicates that highly social animals may show superior transitive reasoning even in nonsocial contexts. We examined the relationship between social complexity and transitive inference in two species of prosimians, a group of primates that diverged from the common ancestor of monkeys, apes, and humans over 50 million years ago. In , highly social ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta, outperformed the less social mongoose lemurs, Eulemur mongoz, in tests of transitive inference and showed more robust representations of the underlying ordinal relationships between the stimuli. In , after training under a correction procedure that emphasized the underlying linear dimension of the series, both species showed similar transitive inference. This finding suggests that the two lemur species differ not in their fundamental ability to make transitive inferences, but rather in their predisposition to mentally organize information along a common underlying dimension. Together, these results support the hypothesis that social complexity is an important selective pressure for the evolution of cognitive abilities relevant to transitive reasoning.},

@article{guyote1981,
	Abstract = {A new theory of syllogistic reasoning, called the transitive-chain theory, is presented. The transitive-chain theory proposes that information about set relations is represented in memory by pairs of informational components. The theory further proposes that information about set relations is integrated by applying a small set of rules to transitive chains of these set relations. The rules that are applied to these chains are specified in detail. The theory is cast in terms of information-processing models for variants of the syllogistic reasoning task, and then mathematical models that quantify each of these information-processing models are presented. In a series of five experiments, the transitive-chain theory provides a good account of the response-choice data for syllogisms with various types of content, quantifiers, and logical relations (categorical and conditional). The results of these experiments offer tentative answers to four issues in the theory of syllogistic reasoning: (a) representation of premise information; (b) combination of premise information; (c) sources of difficulty in syllogistic reasoning; and (d) generality of the processes used in syllogistic reasoning.},

Yet, little is known about the reasons for this correspondence. Category theory was invented as a formal means of establishing commonalities between various mathematical structures. We use category theory to show that transitive inference and class inclusion involve dual mathematical structures, called product and coproduct. Other inferential tasks with similar developmental profiles, including matrix completion, cardinality, dimensional changed card sorting, balance-scale (weight-distance integration), and Theory of Mind also involve these structures. By contrast, (co)products are not involved in the behaviours exhibited by younger children on these tasks, or simplified versions that are within their ability. These results point to a fundamental cognitive principle under development during childhood that is the capacity to compute (co)products in the categorical sense.},

	Abstract = {We aim to provide a new perspective on the old debate about whether evidence for higherorder cognition in nonhuman animals can be reinterpreted in terms of associative learning. Our starting point is the idea that associative learning is best thought of as an effect (i.e., the impact of paired events on behavior) rather than a specific mental process (e.g., the formation of associations). This idea allows us to consider (a) propositional theories according to which associative learning is mediated by higher-order mental processes akin to problem solving and (b) Relational Frame Theory that allows one to think of seemingly simple associative learning effects as instances of a complex phenomenon known as arbitrarily applicable relational responding. Based on these two theories, we argue that (a) higher-order cognition and associative learning are not necessarily mutually exclusive and (b) a more sophisticated conceptualization of higher-order cognition is warranted.},

	Abstract = {In a serial-order task, subjects are trained to respond to five stimuli in a specific order, (e.g., A\textrightarrowB\textrightarrowC\textrightarrowD\textrightarrowE) to obtain a reward. Once the serial-order task is learned, a pairwise test is administered in which all ten pairwise combinations of the five stimuli are presented to the subject. Humans and monkeys respond at high levels on all pairwise items, that is, they respond to the items in the pair in the order in which they appear in the original sequence. Given pair BD, for example, humans and monkeys first respond to item B and then item D. Examination of the latencies reveals that humans and monkeys show a first-item effect, a missing-item effect, and a symbolic-distance effect, all in line with the view that they form a representation of the order of the five items and use that representation to guide their behaviour during the pairwise test. In contrast, pigeons perform poorly on the pairwise test, and show no first-item, missing-item, or symbolic-distance effects, suggesting that although pigeons can learn to respond to five items in a specific order, they do not form a representation of the sequential order of those items. We discuss the extent to which the difference in performance between birds and primates on the serial-order task reflects a difference in cognitive abilities, or whether the difference can be attributed to noncognitive factors.},

	Abstract = {Cebus monkeys were trained on a five-item serial learning task, symbolized as ABCDE; the initial stages of training were on the shorter subseries AB, ABC, and ABCD. To assess the monkeys' knowledge of the sequential position of each item, pair-wise tests were given to 2 subjects after acquisition of the ABCD series and to 4 subjects after reaching criterion on the ABCDE series. In both tests, the monkeys performed at high levels on the interior pairs, which was BC for the ABCD series, and BC, BD, and CD for the ABCDE series. These results, as well as the orderly relations observed in the pair-wise tests between first-item response latency and first-term position and between second-item response latency and number of missing items, indicated that the monkeys had developed a well-organized internal representation of the four- and five-item series. Although pigeons are also capable of learning four-item and five-item series, they apparently do not develop a comparable representational structure. The disparity between the monkeys' and pigeons' representational competence for serial order is predictable from the difference in their capabilities for associative transivity.

After learning their respective list, half of the subjects were trained on a positive pair with reinforcement provided when pairs were responded to in the order true to that of the original sequence (4-item: B\textrightarrowC; 5-item: B\textrightarrowD). The remaining subjects were trained on a negative pair with reinforcement provided for responding to the pairs in the order opposite to that learned in the original sequence (4-item: C\textrightarrowB; 5-item: D\textrightarrowB). Subjects in the positive pair condition learned their respective pair faster than did subjects in the negative pair condition. In Experiment 2, after reaching criterion on a 4-item list, subjects received 16 BC probe trials spread across 4 sessions of training. Subjects performed significantly above chance on the probe trials. The performance of our subjects in Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrates that, similar to monkeys, pigeons form a representation of the lists that they learn.

	Abstract = {Ordinal knowledge is a fundamental aspect of advanced cognition. It is self-evident that humans represent ordinal knowledge, and over the past 20 years it has become clear that nonhuman primates share this ability. In contrast, evidence that nonprimate species represent ordinal knowledge is missing from the comparative literature. To address this issue, in the present experiment we trained pigeons on three 4-item lists and then tested them with derived lists in which, relative to the training lists, the ordinal position of the items was either maintained or changed. Similar to the findings with human and nonhuman primates, our pigeons performed markedly better on the maintained lists compared to the changed lists, and displayed errors consistent with the view that they used their knowledge of ordinal position to guide responding on the derived lists. These findings demonstrate that the ability to acquire ordinal knowledge is not unique to the primate lineage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Adults and 7- and 10-year-olds performed at high levels on both tests, whereas 3- and 4-year-olds did not.

	Abstract = {The term serial learning covers a broad range of phenomena, in no small part because different traditions in psychology disagree about the process and content of such learning. A comprehensive overview of the comparative study of serial learning is therefore best served by considering these many perspectives. This chapter first examines the two major approaches to serial learning used in comparative research. The first variety trains subjects to use implicit serial orderings (e.g., in the study of transitive inference), in which stimulus ordering must be inferred from feedback. The second form trains explicit serial ordering (e.g., the simultaneous chain), such that ordered stimuli remain available to the senses throughout a trial, permitting them to be processed in parallel. A comprehensive account of serial learning can only be accomplished through joint consideration of these two paradigms. In addition, a variety of other phenomena are reviewed that are thought to relate in fundamental ways to serial learning. These include (a) serial learning as a basis for social relations and dominance hierarchies and (b) the psychophysical sense of numerosity and the corresponding use of symbolic numbers. Not only are these domains informed by serial knowledge, but they are also revealing regarding the scope and utility of its cognitive mechanisms. Finally, an overview is presented of the contributions of comparative neuroscience to this topic, thanks to methodological innovations in recording and analysis.

	Abstract = {It is proposed that a cognitive map encoding the relationships between entities in the world supports flexible behavior, but the majority of the neural evidence for such a system comes from studies of spatial navigation. Recent work describing neuronal parallels between spatial and non-spatial behaviors has rekindled the notion of a systematic organization of knowledge across multiple domains. We review experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks that point to principles unifying these apparently disparate functions. These principles describe how to learn and use abstract, generalizable knowledge and suggest that map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds. We highlight how artificial agents endowed with such principles exhibit flexible behavior and learn map-like representations observed in the brain. Finally, we speculate on how these principles may offer insight into the extreme generalizations, abstractions, and inferences that characterize human cognition.},

	Abstract = {Monkeys are able to learn the implied ordering of pairs of images drawn from an ordered set, without ever seeing all of the images simultaneously, and without explicit spatial or temporal cues. Learning is evidenced by their ability to make transitive inferences (TI), which are judgments of serial order based on the transitive relation that A{$>$}B and B{$>$}C implies A{$>$}C. Because posterior parietal cortex has been shown to integrate spatial and numerical information, we recorded the activity of parietal neurons in rhesus macaques while they learned 5- and 7-item TI lists. Symbolic distance (but not ordinal position) strongly predicted decision accuracy, and learning was consistently faster as symbolic distance increased. Neurons exhibited selectivity for stimulus identity during learning, but not before or after. Furthermore, across the population of neurons, there was significant modulation of firing correlated with the relative rank of the two stimuli presented on each trial. The observed behavior during learning is best explained by a virtual workspace model, not by associative or reward mechanisms. The neural data support a role for posterior parietal cortex in representing several variables that contribute to serial learning, particularly information about the ordinal ranks of both stimuli presented during a given trial. Thus, parietal cortex can be considered as part of the neural substrate for learning and representing abstract relationships in a virtual workspace.},

To do so, they appear to make use of transitivity, a property of all ordered sets. Here, we summarize relevant research on the transitive inference (TI) paradigm and its relationship to learning the underlying order of an arbitrary set of items. We compare six computational models of TI performance, three of which are model-free (Q-learning, Value Transfer, and REMERGE) and three of which are model-based (RL-Elo, Sequential Monte Carlo, and Betasort). Our goal is to assess the ability of these models to produce empirically observed features of TI behavior. Model-based approaches perform better under a wider range of scenarios, but no single model explains the full scope of behaviors reported in the TI literature.},
